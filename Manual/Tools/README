# The `polyscripter` Tool

The `polyscripter` tool is a Unix filter program that passes most input lines unchanged, but looks out for those lines beginning with `>>` characters.
If it sees one such, it executes the Poly/ML compiler on that line, captures the result and then emits the input and the response to standard out.

## Inline Options

All of the following inline commands must be the first non-whitespace on the line in which they occur.

-   The usual `>>` command gets the input after this prompt read until the next line that begins with a non-space character.
-   The `>>_` command gets the compiler to act on the accompanying input, and this input is printed out, but the output is elided
-   The `>>__` command gets the compiler to act on the accompanying input, but nothing is printed out.
-   The `>>-` command is similar to `>>_` except the input is suppressed while the output is printed out.
-   The `>>+` command is similar to `>>` except that if the input expression raises an un-handled exception, then rather than aborting execution, the exception will be printed as output.
-   The `##use` command gets the compiler to evaluate the `use` the filename.
    The filename is given after a single space character and is the rest of the line; it need not be quoted, and shouldn’t be followed by a semicolon.
    The compilation and evaluation of the filename is done entirely silently.
-   The `##assert` command gets the compiler to evaluate the following expression (which can just be one line long).
    If it evaluates to true, then nothing is output.
    If it is false, then the scripter aborts.
-   The `##eval` command gets the compiler to evaluate the following code (similarly to the various `>>` commands).
    The output is *not* printed, and the input is printed without a prompt symbol (the `>`).
    The command may be followed by a name in square brackets.
    This can allow further assertion checking on an expression that has been shown to the user.
    For example

        ##eval[n] 3 + 4;
        ##assert (equal n) 7;

    will print `3 + 4` in the document and also silently check that it really does evaluate to 7.
-   The `##parsetm` and `##parsety` commands get the compiler to parse the (multi-line) argument as a HOL term or type and print it back to the output.
    The invocation is done by wrapping the input in ` `` ` delimiters and adding a colon in the case of `##parsety`.
    These directives make it easy to include HOL terms and types in the input while also having them checked for syntactic validity.
    Note that if you want to check/print a type with its colon included, simply use the `parsetm` directive as wrapping that input in the backticks will give the desired effect.
-   The `##thm` command passes the following expression to HOL (and follows it with a `:thm` annotation so that the compiler checks that it really denotes a theorem).
    The output is printed indented on the next line after the input, and without the usual `val it = ` prefix and ` : thm` suffix.
    For example

        ##thm TRUTH

    becomes

        TRUTH
          ⊢ T
          
    You can add digits immediately after the `##thm` to change the linewidth into which the theorem will be pretty-printed. 
    For example, `##thm68 pred_setTheory.SURJ_DEF`.

If the first non-whitespace characters are `>>>` or `###` then the first of these characters is dropped, and the rest of the line is passed unchanged.
This allows for a form of escaping, just in case the input naturally wants to include `>>` or `##` at the start of a line.

## Command-line Options

-   If `polyscripter` is passed a filename as its first argument, this file is read, and treated as a dictionary mapping single (UTF8) characters to replacement strings (with character separated from mapping by whitespace).
    This mapping is applied to user-input strings (after the `>>`) and to compiler output as well.
    An example mapping would include lines such as

           ∀ \(\forall\)
           ∧ \(\land\)

    A mapping for LaTeX `alltt` type environments should also handle backslash and brace characters.
