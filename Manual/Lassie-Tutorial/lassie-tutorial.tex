\paragraph*{Summary}
Interactive theorem proving is a method to perform trustworthy, rigorous
mathematical proofs checked by computers.
From a programmer's point of view, learning an ITP system is similar to
learning a new programming language.
The main difference is that an ITP system allows to first implement a function,
and then prove theorems about it.
This guide is written for experienced programmers, that have seen pen-and-paper
proofs before, but never worked with an ITP system.
If you ever wanted to replace that nice, cozy thought of \emph{this function
should work as I intend it to} with the high-assurance of a rigorous
mathematical proof, this guide is for you\footnote{If you are asking yourself the question how this is even possible, the same reasoning applies.}.
