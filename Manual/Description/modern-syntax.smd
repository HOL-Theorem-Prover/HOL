Files written by HOL users are of the same form as those written by HOL developers.
In this way, HOL aims to be easy to extend, and this chapter’s description of HOL source files should be useful for users and developers both.

HOL organises its files into two categories:

- “script” files that specify a theory segment: where definitions are made, types defined and theorems proved; and

- “library” files that provide SML implementations of important theorem-proving infrastructure, typically providing SML functions to support those actions done in script files (definitions, types, proofs).

Library files are written in SML, using the HOL API that is described both in this manual, but also in the REFERENCE.
Script files have their own rather special syntax that is a superset of SML.
Script files will be the bulk of what most users write.
Both flavours of file should observe the conventions documented in this chapter.

## Library Files

A library is typically implemented in two SML files, `Libname.sig` and `Libname.sml`, where `Libname.sig` defines the SML signature for the library, and the corresponding `.sml` file provides the implementation.
Conventionally, the stem of the file-name is also the name of both the signature and the structure.
If our library is called “foo”, then `foo.sig` would have content:

```
   signature foo =
   sig
    …
   end
```
and `foo.sml` would contain

```
   structure foo :> foo =
   struct
    …
   end
```
Because of the link between the file-name and the SML structure’s name, the stem of the file-name will always be a valid SML identifier (ruling out hyphens, for example).
It is permitted to omit the signature and to have no ascription in the `.sml` file.
To support Moscow ML, when there is a signature, it is recommended to always use opaque ascription with the `:>` token.

By convention, a library written to support work with respect to a particular concept or type will often be called *concept*`Lib`.
Thus, `wordsLib` supports work with the type of fixed-width words.
Another common flavour of library is the so-called “syntax” library, designed to support working with terms and types related to these common syntaxes.
Thus, HOL provides the library `optionSyntax`, where the SML function `mk_some` of type `term -> term`, builds a HOL term with the HOL constant `SOME` applied to the provided argument.
Occasionally, a *concept*`Lib` library will import and re-export the contents of a linked *concept*`Syntax` library.

Generally, library implementations should only provide entry-points to effect changes to the global state of the system; they should *not* directly make changes themselves.
Logical content (definitions of constants, proofs of theorems, *etc.*) should always be prompted by user‐written function calls in script files.
Changes to other aspects of the global state (*e.g.*, the state of the grammar) should also only happen in the body of functions provided by the library, not as a side effect of the library being loaded.

## Script Files

When writing a theory called `name`, the user must write a file with name `nameScript.sml`.
This will ultimately generate an SML structure that users will be able to refer to as `nameTheory`.
That generated structure will contain bindings for the user’s definitions and theorems.
For example, HOL comes with a `dividesScript.sml` that when built allows:
```
>>__ load "dividesTheory";
>> dividesTheory.prime_def;
```
The recommended syntax for a script file begins

```
   Theory <thyname>
   Ancestors <thy1> <thy2> ..
   Libs <lib1> <lib2> ..

   <Script Declarations>
```

The three keywords (`Theory`, `Ancestors` and `Libs`) must all appear in column 0 of the input file.
The `Ancestors` and `Libs` components may be omitted.
The name following the `Theory` keyword must match the name that precedes the `Script.sml` of the file-name, and must be a valid SML structure identifier.

\index{Ancestors keyword@\ml{Ancestors} keyword}
If present, the names following `Ancestors` identify theories that this theory builds upon.
These names should be “bare”: they cannot include the `Theory` suffix.
By default, all of the SML identifiers within the exported theories mentioned in this section are available without qualification.
Thus, if `list` is one of the names following `Ancestors`, one need not write `listTheory.MAP` in the rest of the file to refer to its theorem `MAP`, but can instead write simply `MAP`.
If two ancestor theories use the same names for their exported theories, the names belonging to the theory whose name occurs later in the `Ancestors` list will shadow earlier occurrences.

It is reasonable and permitted to list a theory as an ancestor solely to be able to write its names without qualification.
For example, one need not explicitly write `pred_set` as an ancestor because `pred_setTheory` is always included in HOL’s standard logical context.
Nonetheless, one might mention it in order to be able to write `IN_INSERT` instead of `pred_setTheory.IN_INSERT`.

Finally, one might want a theory as an ancestor, but not to have its SML names available at the top-level.
This effect is achieved by following the theory name with the `[qualified]` annotation.

Table: Script File Syntax.
Square brackets in the table are input characters; they are *not* meta-characters (unlike the parentheses, pipe symbols and superscripts). 
All keywords beginning with capital letters (`Theory`, `Ancestors`, `Libs`, ...) must occur in column 0 of the input file.
The `alias=`*ident* modifier does not make sense immediately after the `Ancestors` and `Libs` keywords;
it should only be used after individual theory or library names to establish aliases for just those names.
