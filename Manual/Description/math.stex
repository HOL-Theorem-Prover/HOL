\subsection{Elementary topology of one-dimensional Euclidean space}
\label{sec:topology}
\index{real\_topology, the HOL theory of@real\_topology, the \HOL{} theory of}

The theory \theoryimp{real_topology} provides some deeper analytical
properties for real numbers and real sets (one-dimensional Euclidean space).
It was ported from HOL Light by Muhammad Qasim and Osman Hasan et al.
In particular, \theoryimp{real_topology} contains more general and
advanced concepts and theorems then those provided by \theoryimp{lim}
and \theoryimp{seq} (Section~\ref{reals}).

% Below is a list of major features found in \theoryimp{real_topology}:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Metric functions (\holtxt{dist}, distance of real numbers);
% \item Linear (\holtxt{linear}) and bilinear (\holtxt{bilinear}) functions;
% \item A bit of linear algebra (\holtxt{subspace} and \holtxt{span}) and their closure properties;
% \item Equality in Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities;
% \item Collinearity (\holtxt{collinear});
% \item Between-ness (\holtxt{between}) and midpoint (\holtxt{midpoint}) between two points;
% \item Open and closed sets;
% \item Open and closed balls;
% \item Open and closed line segments, with open/closed overloading of `(a,b)` and `[a,b]`;
% \item Connectedness (\holtxt{connected});
% \item Limit points (\holtxt{limit_point_of});
% \item Interior of a set (\holtxt{interior});
% \item Closure of a set (\holtxt{closure});
% \item Frontier (aka boundary) (\holtxt{frontier});
% \item ...
% \end{itemize}

There are more than 60 concepts and 1600 theorems in
\theoryimp{real_topology}, including properties of continuous
functions and the completeness of real numbers,
which is the foundation of other higher mathematics
theories, such as differential and integral calculus, measure and probability
theories. For instance, the following version of the \emph{Heine-Borel
  theorem} (and the fact that a real set is compact iff it is bounded and
closed) plays an essential role in the construction of
Borel-measurable spaces in measure theory:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ val oldwidth = !Globals.linewidth;
     val _ = Globals.linewidth := 70;
>>__ load "real_topologyTheory";
>>__ open real_topologyTheory;
##thm COMPACT_EQ_HEINE_BOREL

##thm COMPACT_EQ_BOUNDED_CLOSED
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\subsection{Univariate differential and integral calculus}
\label{sec:calculus}
\index{calculus, the HOL theory of@calculus, the \HOL{} theory of}

An extensive development of (univariate) differential and integral
calculus, ported from HOL Light, is available in the theory \theoryimp{derivative} and
\theoryimp{integration}.

\subsubsection{Derivative}

A quintessentially analytic property is the derivative of a function. One might
expect to find a higher-order `derivative' function \texttt{deriv}
$\colon
(\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R})\rightarrow(\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R})$
mapping a function $f$ to its derivative $f'$. Actually, no such thing
is defined in HOL, but rather a ternary operator
\holtxt{has_derivative} where \holtxt{(f has_derivative f') (at x)}
means `the function $f$ has a derivative $f'$ at the point $x$', or
\holtxt{(f has_derivative f') (at x within s)} means `the function $f$
has a derivative $f'$ at the point $x$ within the set $s$'.
Expanding out the definition, we see that
the definition is much as an analyst might expect:

\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "derivativeTheory";
>>__ open derivativeTheory;
##thm has_derivative_at
##thm has_derivative_within
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Similarily, \holtxt{(f has_vector_derivative f') (at x)} means that \emph{the function $f$
has a derivative with value $f'$ at the point $x$}.
The usual kinds of combining theorems are proved. For example, the derivative
of a sum is the sum of the derivatives:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm HAS_DERIVATIVE_ADD
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\subsubsection{Integration}
\label{sec:integration}

The version of integral calculus formalized in HOL is a
generalized Riemann integration called \emph{Henstock-Kurzweil Integration},
or \emph{gauge integration}~\cite{Bartle:2001um}. Many functions which
are not Riemann integrable can be shown to be Henstock-Kurzweil
integrable. (In particular, a function is Lebesgue integrable if and
only if the function and its absolute value are Henstock-Kurzweil
integrable.)

\holtxt{f integrable_on s} means that \emph{the function $f$ is integrable on a
real set $s$}, while \holtxt{f absolutely_integrable_on s} denotes absolute integrability.
Assuming $f$ is integrable, the usual integration of $f$ on a
(closed) interval $[a,b]$, i.e.~$\displaystyle\int_a^b f \mathrm{d}x$,
is expressed as \holtxt{integral (interval [a,b]) f} in HOL. (In
general, the integration of $f$ on a set $s$ of real numbers is
\holtxt{integral s f}.)

The fundamental theorem of calculus (in the equivalent forms of
Riemann integral) is expressed below:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "integrationTheory";
>>__ open integrationTheory;
##thm FUNDAMENTAL_THEOREM_OF_CALCULUS
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

The above theorem requires that the function $f$ must be everywhere
differentiable (i.e. has derivative) in the closed interval
$[a,b]$. In fact, Henstock-Kurzweil Integration permits a
countable number of exceptional points. This yields a significant
improvement, as shown in the following strong version of the
 fundamental theorem of calculus:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm FUNDAMENTAL_THEOREM_OF_CALCULUS_STRONG
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

% \begin{hol}
% \begin{alltt}
% ##thm integral
% \end{alltt}
% \end{hol}

\subsection{Measure Theory}
\label{sec:measure}
\index{measure, the HOL theory of@measure, the \HOL{} theory of}
\index{sigma_algebra, the HOL theory of@sigma_algebra, the \HOL{} theory of}

The theme of measure theory implemented in \theoryimp{sigma_algebra}
and \theoryimp{measure} theories is the problem of how to assign a size, a
content, a probability, etc.~to certain sets.
The most common examples of \emph{measure} is the length
(in one dimension), area (in two dimensions) and
volume (in three dimensions) in Euclidean spaces.
In \HOL{}'s \theoryimp{measure}
theory, a measure is a set function of the type
$(\alpha \to \konst{bool}) \to \konst{extreal}$.\footnote{The legacy
  \theoryimp{real_measure} theory, where the type of measure is
  $(\alpha \to \konst{bool}) \to \konst{real}$, is still available.}
(See Section~\ref{sec:extreal} for more details of extended real numbers.)
This allows us to express, for example, the ``length'' of the entire
real line $\mathbb{R}$, i.e.~\holtxt{PosInf}.

A reasonable measure should be able to deal with disjoint countable
partitions of sets. Therefore a measure function must be defined on a
system of sets which is stable whenever we repeat any of the basic set
operations--$\cup$, $\cap$, ${}^{\mathrm{c}}$--countably many times, i.e.~$\sigma$-algebra.
In \HOL{}, a system of sets is a pair \holtxt{(sp,sts)}
of the type $(\alpha \to \konst{bool}) \ \#\  ((\alpha \to \konst{bool}) \to
\konst{bool})$ satisfying \holtxt{subset_class sp sts}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "sigma_algebraTheory";
>>__ open sigma_algebraTheory;
##thm subset_class_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Given any system of sets \holtxt{a = (sp,sts)}, the two functions \holtxt{space}
and \holtxt{subsets} can be used to access \holtxt{sp} and
\holtxt{sts}, respectively.
%
Then algebra and $\sigma$-algebra\footnote{Previously these definitions
  were part of \theoryimp{measure} theory. Now they are moved into
  the shared \theoryimp{sigma_algebra} theory for both
  \theoryimp{measure} and \theoryimp{real_measure} theories.} are
defined below:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm algebra_def
##thm sigma_algebra_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
There are several equivalent ways of defining $\sigma$-algebra. The
following alternative definition (as a theorem), for instance,
perfectly matches Definition~3.1 of~\cite{Schilling:2017}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm SIGMA_ALGEBRA_ALT_SPACE
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Any measure (function) must be defined with respect to a \emph{measure space}.
In \HOL{}, a measure space is represented by a tuple \holtxt{(sp,sts,mu)}, where \holtxt{sp} and
\holtxt{sts} forms a $\sigma$-algebra\footnote{Some textbooks call
  \holtxt{sts} itself a $\sigma$-algebra, while \holtxt{(sp,sts)} a \emph{measurable
  space}.}, and \holtxt{mu} is the measure function. If \holtxt{m = (sp,sts,mu)} is a
measure space, the functions \holtxt{m_space},
\holtxt{measurable_sets} and \holtxt{measure} can be used to access
\holtxt{sp}, \holtxt{sts} and \holtxt{mu}, respectively. Any
measure space must be both \holtxt{positive} and \holtxt{countably_additive}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "measureTheory";
>>__ open measureTheory;
##thm measure_space_def
##thm positive_def
##thm countably_additive_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

In particular, if \holtxt{(sp,sts,mu)} is \holtxt{positive} and
\holtxt{countably_additive} but \holtxt{(sp,sts)} is not (yet) a
$\sigma$-algebra, it is called a \emph{premeasure} (space):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm premeasure_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

The reason of introducing premeasure is that it is not a trivial task to assign
\emph{explicitly} a value to \emph{every} set from a $\sigma$-algebra.
Rather than doing this it is often more natural to assign values to
sets from some generators. To get such an automatic
extension the following (technically motivated) class of generators is
useful. A \emph{semiring} (usually denoted by $\mathscr{S}$) is a
family with the following properties:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm semiring_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Any ($\sigma$-)algebra is also a semiring but not vice versa. For
instance, the set of all right open intervals $\big\{ [a,b) \colon
a,b\in\mathbb{R} \big\}$ is a semiring (because the set difference of any
two right open intervals is at most two new right open intervals).
Furthermore, for any system of sets \holtxt{(sp sts)} there exists a smallest
$\sigma$-algebra containing it (also called the $\sigma$-algebra
\emph{generated} from it), denoted by $\sigma(\cdot)$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm sigma_def
##thm SIGMA_ALGEBRA_SIGMA
##thm SIGMA_SUBSET_SUBSETS
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

The following deep extension theorem for measures goes back to
Carath\'{e}odory~\cite{Schilling:2017}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm CARATHEODORY_SEMIRING
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

In addition, the uniqueness of measures extended from generators is
guaranteed by the following theorem, given that the involved
generators are stable under $\cap$ and $\sigma$-finite:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "martingaleTheory";
>>__ open martingaleTheory;
##thm sigma_finite_def
##thm sigma_finite_measure_space_def

##thm UNIQUENESS_OF_MEASURE
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\subsection{Borel Theory}
\label{sec:borel}
\index{borel, the HOL theory of@borel, the \HOL{} theory of}
\index{real_borel, the HOL theory of@real_borel, the \HOL{} theory of}

The theory \theoryimp{real_borel} provides Borel sets and Borel measurable
functions based on reals, in addition the theory \theoryimp{borel} provides
the same things based on extreals, plus the constructions of Borel and
Lebesgue measure spaces.

In \HOL{}, the real-valued Borel sets \holtxt{borel}
$\mathscr{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by
open sets (of the type $\konst{real} \to \konst{bool}$). It can also
be generated by half spaces, open or closed intervals:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "real_borelTheory";
>>__ open real_borelTheory;
##thm borel
##thm borel_eq_le
##thm borel_eq_gr
##thm borel_eq_gr_less
##thm borel_eq_ge_le
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

The extreal-valued Borel sets \holtxt{Borel} $\mathscr{B}(\mathbb{\overline{R}})$
is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by
half spaces of the type $\konst{extreal} \to \konst{bool}$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "borelTheory";
>>__ open borelTheory;
##thm Borel_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Let \holtxt{a} and \holtxt{b} be two measurable spaces
($\sigma$-algebras). A map $f \colon \konst{space}\ a \to \konst{space}\ b$
is called \emph{$a/b$-measurable} (or \emph{measurable} unless this is too ambiguous) if the
pre-image of every measurable set is a measurable set: (the definition
is in \theoryimp{sigma_algebra} theory)
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm measurable_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
A function is called \emph{Borel-measurable} if it is a measurable map from
any measurable space to \holtxt{borel} or \holtxt{Borel}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{verbatim}
val _ = overload_on ("borel_measurable", ``\a. measurable a borel``);
val _ = overload_on ("Borel_measurable", ``\a. measurable a Borel``);
\end{verbatim}
\end{hol}
For instance, a random variable is nothing but a measurable map from
a probability space (which is also a measure space, see
Section~\ref{sec:prob}) to \holtxt{Borel}.
Thus in \HOL{} there are actually two different types of Borel-measurable
functions, real-valued or extreal-valued, each with a large set of
theorems for proving the Borel-measurabilities,
in \theoryimp{real_borel} and \theoryimp{borel} theories,
respectively. Furthermore, if a real-valued function is Borel-measurable,
so is its extreal-valued version:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm IN_MEASURABLE_BOREL_IMP_BOREL
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Construction of Borel measure space (\holtxt{lborel})}

The Borel measure space \holtxt{lborel} (of the type
$(\konst{real} \to \konst{bool}) \ \#\  ((\konst{real} \to \konst{bool}) \to
\konst{bool}) \ \#\ ((\konst{real} \to \konst{bool}) \to \konst{extreal})$)
is the \emph{household} measure space
defined on the real-valued Borel sets (\holtxt{borel}) such that any
interval with end points $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ ($a \leqslant b$) has the
extreal-valued measure of $b - a \in \mathbb{\overline{R}}$. The
construction of \holtxt{lborel} is done by extending a premeasure in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define the system of all \emph{right-open intervals} and a
  ``premeasure'' \holtxt{lambda0} on it:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm right_open_interval
##thm right_open_intervals
##thm lambda0_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
\item Prove that the set of all right open intervals is a semiring and
  the $\sigma$-algebra generated from it is nothing but \holtxt{borel}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm right_open_intervals_semiring

##thm right_open_intervals_sigma_borel
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
\item Prove \holtxt{(space right_open_intervals,subsets right_open_intervals,lambda0)}
(abbreviated as \holtxt{lborel0}) is \holtxt{additive}, \holtxt{finite_additive} and
eventually a \holtxt{premeasure} (\holtxt{positive} and \holtxt{countably_additive}):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lborel0_additive
##thm lborel0_finite_additive
##thm lborel0_premeasure
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
(The proof of \ml{lborel0_premeasure} depends on \theoryimp{real_topology} theory,
especially the Heine-Borel Theorem. See Section~\ref{sec:topology}.)

\item By Carath\'{e}odory Extension Theorem
  (\ml{CARATHEODORY_SEMIRING}, see Section~\ref{sec:measure}), there exists an extension
  of \holtxt{lborel0}, denoted by \holtxt{lborel}, which is now a measure space:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lborel_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
\end{enumerate}
Let \holtxt{lambda = measure lborel}, the measure of the following
typical Borel sets are proven:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lambda_prop
##thm lambda_sing
##thm lambda_open_interval
##thm lambda_closed_interval
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Construction of Lebesgue measure space (\holtxt{lebesgue})}
It is well known that \holtxt{lborel} is not \emph{complete}, in the
sense that if for
non-empty set \holtxt{s} we have \holtxt{lambda s = 0}, it's not true
that all subsets of s has also the measure 0, as some of them
may not be Borel sets at all. The completion of \holtxt{lborel} is called
\emph{Lebesgue measure space}, denoted by \holtxt{lebesgue}.
In \HOL{}, it is defined directly by Henstock-Kurzweil integration
(see Section~\ref{sec:integration}):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lebesgue_def
##thm line
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
The above definition indeed defines a $\sigma$-algebra and measure
space. The Lebesgue measure of closed intervals is also proven
(directly by \theoryimp{integration} theory):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm sigma_algebra_lebesgue
##thm measure_space_lebesgue
##thm lebesgue_closed_interval
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Now comes the relationship between \holtxt{lborel} and \holtxt{lebesgue}, which have two
very different definitions. In fact, all Borel-measurable sets are
also Lebesgue-measurable sets:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm borel_imp_lebesgue_sets
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Finally, by uniqueness of measure, the two measure spaces
\holtxt{lborel} and \holtxt{lebesgue} coincide on Borel sets (recall
that \holtxt{lambda} is an abbreviation of \holtxt{measure lborel}):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lebesgue_eq_lambda
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\subsection{Lebesgue Integration Theory}
\label{sec:lebesgue}
\index{lebesgue, the HOL theory of@lebesgue, the \HOL{} theory of}

The fundamental idea of \emph{integration} is to measure the area between the graph
of a function and the abscissa (i.e.~$x$-axis).
Riemann's approach partitions the domain of the function without
taking into account the shape of the function,
thus slicing up the area under the function \emph{vertically}. Lebesgue's approach is
exactly the opposite: the domain is partitioned according to the values of the
function at hand, leading to a \emph{horizontal} decomposition of the area.

In case the values of the function $f$ is finite, its domain can also be
decomposed into the same number of disjoint sets (but each of them may
not be a continuous interval). If the function is also nonnegative,
i.e.~$\forall x.\,0 \leqslant f(x)$, this function is called a
\emph{positive simple function} which can be also represented by a
finite sum:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:posSimpleFn}
  f = \sum_{j=0}^M y_j \mathbbm{1}_{A_j},\quad\text{where $\forall
    x\in A_j.\,f(x) = y_j$}.
\end{equation}
And the ``integration'' of $f$ is simply $\sum_{j=0}^M y_j\mu(A_j)$,
where $\mu$ is the measure function of a measure space,
e.g.~\holtxt{lborel} and \holtxt{lebesgue} constructed in Section~\ref{sec:borel}.
Note that the representations of positive simple functions are not
unique, but each representation can be uniquely determined by an index
set $J$, a disjoint set of sets $A_j, j \in J$ and the set of values $y_j$
corresponding to each $A_j$. In \HOL{}, the connection between
positive simple functions (extreal-valued) and their representations
(\ref{eq:posSimpleFn}) is captured by \holtxt{pos_simple_fn}, while
the integration of positive simple functions is defined by
\holtxt{pos_simple_fn_integral}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "lebesgueTheory";
>>__ open lebesgueTheory;
##thm pos_simple_fn_def

##thm pos_simple_fn_integral_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Since the representations of a positive simple function are not unique,
for each positive simple function there exists a set of
representations (\holtxt{psfs}), and a set of integrations
(\holtxt{psfis}) (although it can be proved that all these integrations are the
same). The \emph{integration} of an arbitrary positive function $f$ is defined
as the supremum of all positive simple functions $g$ which is pointwise smaller than $f$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm pos_fn_integral_def
##thm psfs_def
##thm psfis_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

For any positive function $f$, it is
possible to construct a pointwise increasing sequence of positive simple functions $f_i$
which is always pointwise smaller than $f$. In another words, each
$f(x)$ is the limit of $f_i(x)$ which is mono-increasing with $i$.
Then the following monotone convergence theorem (actually due to Beppo
Levi, see~\cite[p. 75]{Schilling:2017}) reduces the integration of $f$
to the limit of integrations of $f_i$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm lebesgue_monotone_convergence
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Finally, the (Lebesgue) integration of an arbitrary function $f$ is defined
by the subtraction of integrations of its positive and negative parts:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm integral_def
##thm fn_plus_def
##thm fn_minus_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Note that it is possible that the two integrations in the above
definition both results to \holtxt{PosInf}, the entire integration is not
specified (see Section~{sec:extreal} for more details on extreal arithmetics).
A function $f$ is \emph{(Lebesgue) integrable} if it is
Borel-measurable and the integrations of its positive and negative
parts are both finite (i.e.~not $+\infty$):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm integrable_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

A large set of theorems are provided in \theoryimp{lebegue} theory on
the properties of integrable functions and their
integrations, including the following famous \emph{Markov's inequality}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm markov_inequality
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Null sets and `almost everywhere'}
A measurable set is called \emph{null set} (with respect to its
measure space) if its measure is zero:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm null_set_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

A property $P(x)$ holds \emph{almost everywhere} (AE) in a measure
space $m$, denoted by ``\holtxt{AE x::m. P x}'' in
\HOL{}\footnote{\holtxt{AE} is defined as a \emph{restricted quantifier (binder)}. See
\ml{associate_restriction} in \REFERENCE.}, if $P(x)$ holds
for every $x$ excluding a null set:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm AE_THM
##thm almost_everywhere_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

`Almost everywhere' is the basis of AE convergence in probability
theory (see the next section). The following two theorems about the
integration on null sets are very useful (Theorem 11.2 of~\cite[p.~89-90]{Schilling:2017}):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm integral_abs_eq_0
##thm integral_null_set
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Radon-Nikod\'{y}m Theorem}

So far there is no concept ``derivative''
being discussed. In Lebesgue integration, \emph{Radon-Nikod\'{y}m (RN) Theorem}
(see, e.g.~\cite[p.~230]{Schilling:2017} or
\cite[p.~382]{Fitzpatrick:2010vd}) has the position of "Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus" as in Riemann Integration.
Recall in Lebesgue's theory one starts directly from the
concept ``integration'' without defining ``derivative'' first. It is RN
theorem which introduces the concept of ``derivative'' for Lebesgue
integration and asserts its existence. The theorem says that for any
$\sigma$-finite measure space $m$, if there is another measure $v$ absolutely
continuous with respect to $m$, i.e.~whenever any set $s$ has zero measure
in measure space $m$ it also has same zero measure in $v$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm measure_absolutely_continuous_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Then there exists a nonnegative Borel-measurable function $f$ such that
the (positive) integral of $f$ on any measurable set $s$ is exactly $v(s)$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm Radon_Nikodym

##thm density_measure_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Given two such measures $m$ and $v$, The function $f$ asserted by RN theorem is called
\emph{Radon-Nikod\'{y}m derivative} (denoted by
$\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}m}$ in textbooks but
overloaded on division in \HOL{}):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm RN_deriv_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
The overloading of \holtxt{*} (\holtxt{density_measure}) and
\holtxt{/} (\holtxt{RN_deriv}) with the particular argument order is to
syntactically have \holtxt{f * m / m = v / m = f}.

\subsection{Probability Theory}
\label{sec:prob}
\index{probability, the HOL theory of@probability, the \HOL{} theory of}

\HOL{} provides a comprehensive formalization of \theoryimp{probability}
theory based on the thesis work of
Joe Hurd~\cite{hurd-thesis} (2002),
Aaron R.~Coble~\cite{coble-thesis} (2010),
Osman Hasan~\cite{hasan-thesis} (2008),
Tarek Mhamdi~\cite{mhamdi-thesis} (2012) and
Muhammad Qasim~\cite{qasim-thesis} (2016). % this last one is not fully ported yet
In \HOL{}, the \theoryimp{probability} theory is based on
\theoryimp{pred_set}, \theoryimp{measure}, \theoryimp{borel} and \theoryimp{lebesgue}
theories, etc.

\paragraph{Probability space}

Probability theory enables us to give a probabilistic-statistical
description of experiments with a finite or infinite number of
outcomes. Based on Kolmogorov's axiomatization~\cite{Kolmogorov:1950},
a \emph{probabilistic model} (of an experiment) or a
\emph{probability space} (\holtxt{prob_space}) is an ordered triple
$(\Omega,\mathscr{F},\mathscr{P})$ where,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Omega$ is a set of points $\omega$, also called a \emph{sample
    space} (of ``elementary events'' or outcomes);
\item $\mathscr{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$;
\item $\mathscr{P}$ is a probability measure on $\mathscr{F}$
  ($\mathscr{P}\{\cdot\} \in [0,1]$).
\end{itemize}

Let \holtxt{p} be a probability space, i.e.~\holtxt{prob_space p},
the functions \holtxt{p_space}, \holtxt{events} and \holtxt{prob} can be used to access
each components of the triple. Thus a probability space is nothing but
a measure space where the measure of the sample space is one:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
>>__ load "probabilityTheory";
>>__ open probabilityTheory;
##thm prob_space_def
##thm p_space_def
##thm events_def
##thm prob_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
If \holtxt{E} is an event, the statement that ``the probability of $E$ is
$r$'' ($\mathscr{P}\{E\} = r$) is denoted by ``\holtxt{prob p e = r}'' in \HOL{}.
As probability theory is based on set theory, it is useful to have a table
(see Table~\ref{tab:probability}) displaying the ways in which various
concepts are interpreted in the two theories.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Various concepts in set theory and probability theory}
\label{tab:probability}
\end{figure}

Many properties of probability and events are migrated directly from
\theoryimp{measure} theory. For instance, the following theorems states
that probability is increasing, additive and countably additive, respectively:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm PROB_INCREASING
##thm PROB_ADDITIVE
##thm PROB_COUNTABLY_ADDITIVE
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Also note that, the type of probabilities is $\konst{extreal}$ in
\HOL{}\footnote{The legacy \theoryimp{real_probability}, where all
  probabilities are real-valued, is still available.}, even the actual
probability values are always between 0 and 1. The following
simple theorem which states that the probability of any event cannot
be infinite, is useful in many proofs (when dealing with extreal arithmetics):
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm PROB_FINITE
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Conditional probability}

\HOL{} provides a formalization of elementary ``conditional
probability''~\cite[p.~21]{Shiryaev:2016vm}, originally developed by Liya Liu in 2012, in both
\theoryimp{probability} and \theoryimp{real_probability} theories. The
probability that $e_1$ occurs assuming $e_2$ occurs, i.e.~$\mathscr{P}\{e_1
\mid e_2\}$, is denoted by ``\holtxt{cond_prob p e1 e2}'' in \HOL{}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm cond_prob_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Among other common properties, the \emph{Total Probability Formula}
and the famous \emph{Bayes' Rule} (specific and general
versions)~\cite[Chapter V]{Feller:2004vv} are provided:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm TOTAL_PROB_SIGMA

##thm BAYES_RULE

##thm BAYES_RULE_GENERAL_SIGMA
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Random variable}

The concept ``random variable'' (r.v.) serves to
define quantities describing the results of ``measurements'' in random
experiments. A random variable is a measurable function from
a probability space $p$ to a $\sigma$-algebra (measurable space) $s$,
denoted by \holtxt{random_variable X p s} in \HOL{}.
However, many theorems in \theoryimp{probability} focus on extreal-
and finite-valued r.v.'s from probability spaces to \holtxt{Borel} sets.
They are called \holtxt{real_random_variable}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm random_variable_def
##thm real_random_variable_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Let the probability space be $(\Omega,\mathscr{F},\mathscr{P})$, a
(probability) \emph{distribution} is a probability measure
on $(\Omega,\mathscr{F})$, while a \emph{distribution function}
is a special distribution defined on half spaces $(-\infty,x]$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm distribution_def
##thm distribution_function
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Note that the distribution (measure) of any random variable also forms a
probability space with its target measurable space:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm distribution_prob_space
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Independence}

\begin{quote}\textit{The concept of mutual independence of two or more experiments holds,
in a certain sense, a central position in the theory of
probability.}\\\hfill{}Kolmogorov~\cite[p.~8]{Kolmogorov:1950}
\end{quote}
Informally, events or random variables are independent if they do not
affect each other's probabilities. Thus, two events $A$ and $B$ are independent
if $\mathscr{P}\{A \cap B\} = \mathscr{P}\{A\}\mathscr{P}\{B\}$. Moreover, a finite
collection of events is said to be \emph{pairwise independent} if each
two of them are independent:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm indep_def
##thm pairwise_indep_events_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
More generally, a possibly infinite sequence of events
$\{E_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}$ is said to be (totally) independent if for each
$j\in\mathbb{N}$ and distinct \emph{finite} choice
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_j \in J$, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \mathscr{P}\{E_{\alpha_1} \cap E_{\alpha_2} \cap \cdots \cap E_{\alpha_j}\} =
  \mathscr{P}\{E_{\alpha_1}\} \,\mathscr{P}\{E_{\alpha_2}\} \,\cdots\, \mathscr{P}\{E_{\alpha_j}\}
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm indep_events_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

We shall on occasion also talk about independence of
\emph{collections} (sets) of events:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm indep_families_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

We shall also talk about independence of r.v.'s. Random
variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if for all Borel sets $a$ and $b$, the
events $X^{-1}(a)$ and $Y^{-1}(b)$ are independent:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm indep_rv_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

For sequences of events and r.v.'s there are also
\emph{pairwise} (\holtxt{pairwise_indep_sets} and
\holtxt{pairwise_indep_vars}) and \emph{total} (\holtxt{indep_sets},
\holtxt{indep_vars}) independences with similar definitions as
\holtxt{pairwise_indep_events} and \holtxt{indep_events},
respectively. Note that total independence always implies pairwise independence:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm total_imp_pairwise_indep_events

##thm total_imp_pairwise_indep_sets

##thm total_imp_pairwise_indep_vars
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Limit events}

An important concept in set theory is that of the ``$\limsup$'' and
``$\liminf$'' of a sequence of sets. These notions can be defined for
subsets of an arbitrary sample space. Let $E_n$ be any sequence of
events, we define the following two ``limit events'':
\begin{equation*}
  \limsup_n E_n = \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{n=m}^{\infty} E_n,\qquad
  \liminf_n E_n = \bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{n=m}^{\infty} E_n\enspace.
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm set_limsup_def
##thm set_liminf_def

##thm EVENTS_LIMSUP
##thm EVENTS_LIMINF
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Intuitively, a point belongs to $\limsup_n E_n$ if and only if it belongs to \emph{infinitely
many} terms of the sequence $\{E_n\}$. A point belongs to $\liminf_n E_n$ if
and only if it belongs to all terms of the sequence from a certain
term on (i.e.~\emph{almost always}). The following two deep results, together referred to as
\emph{the Borel-Cantelli lemma}~\cite[p.~80]{Chung:2001}, are useful
in proving other deep results in probability theory:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm Borel_Cantelli_Lemma1

##thm Borel_Cantelli_Lemma2p
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Tail algebra and tail events}

Given a sequence of events $E_1, E_2, \ldots$, we define their
\emph{tail algebra} (or \emph{tail field}) by
\begin{equation*}
  \tau = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \sigma(E_n, E_{n+1}, E_{n+2}, \ldots)
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm tail_algebra_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

In words, an event $E \in \tau$ must have the property that for any $n$, it depends
only on the events $E_n, E_{n+1}, \ldots$; in particular, it does not care about any
finite number of the events $E_n$. Events that belongs to tail
algebras is called \emph{tail events} (or \emph{remote events}). A surprising theorem is the
following \emph{Kolmogorov Zero-One Law}~\cite[p.~37]{Rosenthal:2007vn} which states that,
if the tail algebra is generated from independent events), the
probability of remote events can only be zero or one:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm Kolmogorov_0_1_Law
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Mathematical Expectation}
\begin{quote}\textit{
To achieve reasonable simplicity it is often necessary to describe
probability distributions rather summarily by a few `typical
values.' ... Among the typical values the \emph{(mathematical) expectation},
or \emph{mean}, is by far the most important.
It lends itself best to analytical manipulations, and it is
preferred by statisticians because of a property known as sampling stability.}\hfill{}Feller~\cite[p.~221]{Feller:2004vv}
\end{quote}
Formally, expectation is nothing but a synonym of (Lebesgue) integration:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm expectation_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
Thus most properties of expectation in \theoryimp{probability} theory
are migrated from properties of Lebesgue integration. For instance,
the following theorem is the probability version of the \emph{Markov's inequality}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm prob_markov_ineq
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

In particular, for any random variable $X$ the value
\holtxt{expectation p X} (usually
denoted by $\mathscr{E}(X)$ in textbooks) exists if and only if the
random variable as a measurable function is integrable,
i.e.~\holtxt{integrable p X}.

\paragraph{Second moments and variance}

Let $a$ be extreal, $r$ positive, then $\mathscr{E}(|X - a|^r)$ is
called the \emph{absolute moment}
of $X$ of order $r$, about $a$. It may be $+\infty$; otherwise, and if $r$ is an integer,
$\mathscr{E}((X - a)^r)$ is the corresponding \emph{moment}:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm absolute_moment_def
##thm moment_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

For $r = 1$, $a = 0$, this reduces to $\mathscr{E}(X)$ (expectation or mean).
The moments about the mean are called \emph{central moments}. That of order 2 is
particularly important and is called the \emph{variance}, usually
denoted by $\sigma^2(X)$ or $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm central_moment_def
##thm variance_def
##thm variance_alt
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

The formula $\sigma^2(X) = \mathscr{E}(X^2) - \mathscr{E}(X)^2$ is well known in elementary
probability, so is Chebyshev's inequality:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm variance_eq
##thm chebyshev_ineq_variance
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Note that, for the above formulae to hold, the r.v.~$X$ must have
\emph{finite second moments}, which has several equivalent definitions:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm finite_second_moments_def

##thm finite_second_moments_literally
##thm finite_second_moments_eq_integrable_square
##thm finite_second_moments_eq_finite_variance
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
In particular, if a (finite-valued) random variable $X$ has finite second moments, or
equivalently $X^2$ is integrable, then $X$ itself is also integrable:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm finite_second_moments_imp_integrable
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Finally, for \emph{uncorrelated} r.v.'s (i.e.~$\mathscr{E}(XY) =
\mathscr{E}(X)\mathscr{E}(Y)$), the following ``additivity of the variance'' holds:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm uncorrelated_def
##thm uncorrelated_vars_def

##thm variance_sum
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Convergence of random sequences}

Given a (countable) sequence of finite r.v.'s $X_n$ and another finite
r.v. $Y$, the following three concepts of convergence (from $X_n$ to $Y$)
are defined in \HOL{} (assuming all involved r.v.'s satisfy \holtxt{real_random_variable}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sequence of
r.v.~$\{X_n\}$ is said to converge \emph{almost everywhere (a.e.)} (to the
r.v.~$Y$) iff there exists a null set $\mathbf{N}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \forall \omega\in\Omega\setminus\mathbf{N}.\, \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
  X_n(\omega) = Y(\omega)\;\text{finite.}
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_AE_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\item The sequence $\{X_n\}$
is said to converge \emph{in probability (pr.)} to $Y$ iff for every $\epsilon > 0$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mathscr{P}\{|X_n - Y| > \epsilon \} = 0.
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_PR_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\item The sequence $\{X_n\}$ is said to converge in $L^p$ to $Y$ iff
  $X_n \in L^p$, $Y \in L^p$ and
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mathscr{E}(|X_n - Y|^p) = 0.
\end{equation*}
or formally
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_LP_def
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}
\end{enumerate}

The above three definitions all look very different with each
other. And it is actually very hard to work directly with \holtxt{converge_AE},
which says that, except for a null set, for all other
point $\omega$ in the sample space, the limit of $X_n(\omega)$ is
$Y(\omega)$.
However, several equivalent theorems can be used to convert that "limit" to
something else, namely $\sup$, $\inf$, $\limsup$ and $\liminf$. The most important
one is the following:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_AE_alt_limsup
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Recall that $\limsup_n E_n$ means ``$E_n$ occurs infinitely often'' (cf. Borel-Cantelli
Lemma). Now it should be clear why ``convergence a.e.'' implies
``convergence in pr.'': the former says that it is impossible (zero
probability) that $|X_n(\omega) - Y(\omega)| > e$ holds "infinitely often" when $n$
increases. In another words, after certain $N$, for all $n > N$,
$\mathscr{P}(|X_n(\omega) - Y(\omega)| > e)$ is exactly zero. Of course this
implies ``in pr.'' which only requires this probability be ``close to
zero''. The converse does not hold, simply because a probability very
small and close to zero is still not zero, thus it is not a null set,
and cannot fit with the definition of ``convergence a.e.''. Indeed, we
can prove that ``a.e.'' implies ``in pr.'':
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_AE_imp_PR

##thm converge_AE_imp_PR'
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

Note that in all above concepts the convergence ``from $X$ to $Y$'' and ``from
$X - Y$ to 0'' are equivalent, for instance:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_AE_to_zero

##thm converge_PR_to_zero
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

On the other hand, $L^p$ convergence implies ``in pr.'', but so far
only a special version (converge to zero, with integer-valued power)
is provided:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm converge_LP_imp_PR'
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\paragraph{Limit theorems and the laws of large numbers}

\begin{quote}
\textit{
In the formal construction of a course in the theory of probability, limit theorems appear as a kind of superstructure over elementary chapters, in which all problems have finite, purely arithmetical character.
In reality, however, the epistemological value of the theory of probability is revealed only by limit theorems.
Moreover, without limit theorems it is impossible to understand the real content of the primary concept of all our sciences---the concept of probability.}\\\hfill\mbox{Gnedenko~\cite[p.~1]{Gnedenko:1954vf}}
\end{quote}

It is sometimes convenient to think of probabilities intuitively as
limits of observable \emph{frequencies} in repeated experiments. This
would lead to the following intuitive interpretation of the
expectation. Let an experiment be repeated $n$ times `under identical
conditions,' and denote by $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ the values of $X$ that
were actually observed. For large $n$ the average $(X_1 + \cdots +
X_n)/n$ should be close to $\mathscr{E}(X)$. The laws of large numbers
give substance and precision to this vague intuitive description~\cite[p.~221]{Feller:2004vv}.
%
More generally, the so-called ``Law of Large Numbers'' deals with the
partial sums of an infinite sequence of random variables
$S_n = \sum_{j=1}^n X_j$. Under certain conditions
$(S_n - \mathscr{E}(S_n))/n$ converges to 0, in probability
(weak law) or almost everywhere (strong law).

For uncorrelated r.v.'s with a common bound of variance, the proof is
simple and based on Markov's and Chebyshev's inequalities. The centered
average actually converges to 0 in $L^2$, thus also in
probability~\cite[108]{Chung:2001}.
Under the same hypotheses it also converges to 0 almost everywhere:
\begin{hol}
\begin{alltt}
##thm WLLN_uncorrelated'

##thm SLLN_uncorrelated'
>>__ val _ = Globals.linewidth := oldwidth;
\end{alltt}
\end{hol}

\subsection{Probability theory (legacy)}

The legacy probability theory based on real numbers (and all dependent
theories) is still available from \theoryimp{real_probability}
theory, to support legacy user code and two official examples
(\ml{miller} and \ml{diningcryptos}). The whole theory consists of
\begin{description}
\item [real_measure] The $[0,+\infty)$-measure theory (based on real numbers).
\item [real_borel] The theory of Borel sets and Borel measurable
  functions based on real numbers.\footnote{\theoryimp{real_borel} is shared with extreal-based
  \theoryimp{measure} and \theoryimp{probability} theories. Also
  \theoryimp{sigma_algebra} is shared by both probability theories.}
\item [real_lebesgue] The theory of Lebesgue integration based on real numbers.
\item [real_probability] Probability theory based on real numbers.
\end{description}

Most theorems in the above theories have the same (or similar) name
and statements with their extreal-based companies, to ease the
difficulities when porting proofs to the new measure and probability theories.

In \ml{\$(HOLDIR)/examples/miller}, done by Hurd~\cite{hurd-thesis},
first a type of Boolean sequences is defined
to model an infinite sequence of coin flips. Next a probability
function is formalized which takes as input a set of Boolean
sequences, and returns a real number between 0 and 1.
Building on this foundation, the probability theory is used to define
a sampling function that takes an infinite sequence of coin flips and
a positive integer $N$, and returns an integer $n$ in the range $0\le
n < N$, picked uniformly at random from the available choices. This
sampling function for the uniform distribution is later used to verify
the Miller-Rabin primality test.

\subsection{Further theories of higher mathematics}

In \ml{\$(HOLDIR)/examples/algebra} there is an abstract algebra
library for HOL4. The algebraic types
are generic, so the library is useful in general.
The algebraic structures consist of
\begin{description}
\item [monoidTheory] for monoids with identity,
\item [groupTheory] for groups,
\item [ringTheory] for commutative rings (not to be confused with
the other \theoryimp{ring} theory in core library),
\item [fieldTheory] for fields,
\item [polynomialTheory] for polynomials with coefficients from rings or fields,
\item [linearTheory] for vector spaces, including linear independence, and
\item [finitefieldTheory] for finite fields, including existence and uniqueness.
\end{description}
