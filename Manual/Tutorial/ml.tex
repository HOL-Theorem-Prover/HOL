\chapter{Introduction to ML}
\label{ML}

This chapter is a brief introduction to the meta-language \ML.  The aim is just
to give a feel  for what  it is  like to  interact with  the language.   A more
detailed introduction can be found in \DESCRIPTION.

\section{How to interact with ML}

\ML\ is an interactive programming language like Lisp. At top level one can
evaluate expressions and perform declarations. The former results in the
expression's value and type being printed, the latter in a value being
bound to a name.

The normal way to interact with \ML\ is to configure the workstation screen so that
there are two windows:
\begin{myenumerate}
\item An editor window into which \ML\ commands are initially typed and recorded.
\item A shell window (or non-Unix equivalent) which is used to evaluate the
commands.
\end{myenumerate}

\noindent A common way to achieve this is to work inside \ml{Emacs} with a text
window and a shell window.

After typing a command into the edit (text) window it can be
transferred to the shell and evaluated in \HOL\ by `cut-and-paste'. In
\ml{Emacs} this is done by copying the text into a buffer and then
`yanking' it into the shell. On an {\small IBM PC} it can be done
using a proprietary window system; on a Macintosh it can be done using
the Mac's window system. The advantage of working via an editor is
that if the command has an error, then the text can simply be edited
and used again; it also records the commands in a file which can then
be used again (via a batch load) later. In \ml{Emacs}, the shell
window also records the session, including both input from the user
and the system's response. The sessions in this tutorial were produced
this way. These sessions are split into segments displayed in boxes
with a number in their top right hand corner (to indicate their
position in the complete session).

The interactions in these boxes should be understood as occurring in
sequence.  For example, variable bindings made in earlier boxes are assumed
to persist to later ones.  To enter the \HOL\ system one types
{\small\verb%hol%} to Unix.\footnote{The Unix prompt is {\small\tt \%}.}
The \HOL\ system then prints a sign-on message and puts one into \ML.  The
\ML\ prompt is {\small\verb%#%}, so lines beginning with {\small\verb%#%}
are typed by the user and other lines are the system's response.

#1.[2;3;4;5];;
[1; 2; 3; 4; 5] : int list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

The \ML\ expression {\small\verb%1.[2;3;4;5]%} has the form $e_1\ op\ e_2$ where
$e_1$ is the expression {\small\verb%1%} (whose value is the integer $1$), $e_2$ is
the expression {\small\verb%[2;3;4;5]%} (whose value is a list of four integers)
and $op$ is the infixed operator `{\small\verb%.%}' which is like Lisp's {\it cons}
function. Other list processing functions include {\small\verb%hd%} ($car$ in
Lisp), {\small\verb%tl%} ($cdr$ in Lisp) and {\small\verb%null%} ($null$ in Lisp).
The double semicolon `{\small\verb%;;%}' terminates a top-level phrase.  The
system's response is shown on the line not starting with a prompt.  It consists of
the value of the expression followed, after a colon, by its type. The \ML\
type
checker infers the type of expressions using methods invented by Robin Milner
\cite{Milner-types}. The type {\small\verb%int list%} is the type of `lists of
integers'; {\small\verb%list%} is a unary type operator.  The type system of \ML\
is very similar to the type system of the \HOL\ logic which is explained in
Chapter~\ref{HOLlogic}.

The value of the last expression evaluated at top-level in \ML\ is always
remembered in a variable called {\small\verb%it%}.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#let l = it;;
l = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] : int list

#tl l;;
[2; 3; 4; 5] : int list

#hd it;;
2 : int

#tl(tl(tl(tl(tl l))));;
[] : int list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

Following standard $\lambda$-calculus usage, the application of a function
$f$ to an argument $x$ can be written without brackets as $f\ x$ (although
the more conventional $f${\small\verb%(%}$x${\small\verb%)%} is also
allowed).  The expression $f\ x_1\ x_2\ \cdots\ x_n$ abbreviates the less
intelligible expression {\small\verb%(%}$\cdots${\small\verb%((%}$f\ x_1$%
{\small\verb%)%}$x_2${\small\verb%)%}$\cdots${\small\verb%)%}$x_n$
(function application is left associative).

Declarations have the form {\small\verb%let %}$x_1${\small\verb%=%}$e_1${\small\verb% and %}$\cdots
${\small\verb% and %}$x_n${\small\verb%=%}$e_n$ and result in the value of
each expression $e_i$ being bound to the name $x_i$.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#let l1 = [1;2;3] and l2 = [`a`;`b`;`c`];;
l1 = [1; 2; 3] : int list
l2 = [`a`; `b`; `c`] : string list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

\ML\ expressions like {\small\verb%`a`%}, {\small\verb%`b`%},
{\small\verb%`foo`%} \etc\ are {\it strings\/} and have type
{\small\verb%string%}. Any sequence of {\small ASCII} characters can be
written between the quotes. The function {\small\verb%words%} splits a
single string into a list of single character strings, using space as
separator.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#words`a b c`;;
[`a`; `b`; `c`] : string list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

An expression of the form
{\small\verb%(%}$e_1${\small\verb%,%}$e_2${\small\verb%)%} evaluates to a
pair of the values of $e_1$ and $e_2$. If $e_1$ has type $\sigma_1$ and
$e_2$ has type $\sigma_2$ then
{\small\verb%(%}$e_1${\small\verb%,%}$e_2${\small\verb%)%} has type
$\sigma_1${\small\verb%#%}$\sigma_2$.  A tuple
{\small\verb%(%}$e_1${\small\verb%,%}$\ldots${\small\verb%,%}$e_n${\small\verb%)%}
is equivalent to
{\small\verb%(%}$e_1${\small\verb%,(%}$e_2${\small\verb%,%}$\ldots${\small\verb%,%}$e_n${\small\verb%))%}
(\ie\ `{\small\verb%,%}' is right associative).  The brackets around pairs
and tuples are optional; the system doesn't print them. The first and
second components of a pair can be extracted with the \ML\ functions
{\small\verb%fst%} and {\small\verb%snd%} respectively.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#(1,true,`abc`);;
(1,true, `abc`) : (int # bool # string)

#snd it;;
(true, `abc`) : (bool # string)


#fst it;;
true : bool
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

\noindent The \ML\ expressions {\small\verb%true%} and {\small\verb%false%}
denote the two truth values of type {\small\verb%bool%}.

\ML\ types can contain the {\it type variables\/} {\small\verb%*%},
{\small\verb%**%}, {\small\verb%***%}, \etc\ Such types are called {\it
polymorphic\/}. A function with a polymorphic type should be thought of as
possessing all the types obtainable by replacing type variables by types.
This is illustrated below with the function {\small\verb%zip%}.

Functions are defined with declarations of the form {\small\verb%let%}$\ f\
v_1\ \ldots\ v_n$ \ml{=} $e$ where each $v_i$ is either a variable or a pattern
built out of variables.\footnote{The chapters on ML in \DESCRIPTION\ give
exact details.} Recursive functions are declared with
{\small\verb%letrec%} instead of {\small\verb%let%}.

The function {\small\verb%zip%}, below, converts a pair of lists
{\small\verb%([%}$x_1${\small\verb%;%}$\ldots${\small\verb%;%}$x_n$%
{\small\verb%], [%}$y_1${\small\verb%;%}$\ldots${\small\verb%;%}$y_n$%
{\small\verb%])%} to a list of pairs
{\small\verb%[(%}$x_1${\small\verb%,%}$y_1${\small\verb%);%}$\ldots$%
{\small\verb%;(%}$x_n${\small\verb%,%}$y_n${\small\verb%)]%}.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#letrec zip(l1,l2) =
#if null l1 or null l2
# then []
# else (hd l1,hd l2).zip(tl l1,tl l2);;
zip = - : ((* list # ** list) -> (* # **) list)

#zip([1;2;3],[`a`;`b`;`c`]);;
[(1,`a`); (2,`b`); (3,`c`)] : (int # string) list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

Functions may be {\it curried\/}, \ie\ take their arguments `one at a time'
instead of as a tuple.  This is illustrated with the function
{\small\verb%curried_zip%} below:

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#let curried_zip l1 l2 = zip(l1,l2);;
curried_zip = - : (* list -> ** list -> (* # **) list)

#let zip_num = curried_zip [0;1;2];;
zip_num = - : (* list -> (int # *) list)

#zip_num [`a`;`b`;`c`];;
[(0, `a`); (1, `b`); (2, `c`)] : (int # string) list
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}


Curried functions are useful because they can be `partially applied' as
illustrated above by the partial application of {\small\verb%curried_zip%}
to {\small\verb%[0;1;2]%} which results in the function
{\small\verb%zip_num%}.

The evaluation of an expression either {\it succeeds\/} or {\it fails\/}.
In the former case, the evaluation returns a value; in the latter case the
evaluation is aborted and a failure string (usually the name of the
function that caused the failure) is passed to whatever invoked the
evaluation. This context can either propagate the failure (this is the
default) or it can {\it trap\/} it. These two possibilities are illustrated
below.  A failure trap is an expression of the form
$e_1${\small\verb%?%}$e_2$. An expression of this form is evaluated by
first evaluating $e_1$. If the evaluation succeeds (\ie\ doesn't fail) then
the value of $e_1${\small\verb%?%}$e_2$ is the value of $e_1$.  If the
evaluation of $e_1$ fails, then the value of $e_1${\small\verb%?%}$e_2$ is
obtained by evaluating $e_2$.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#hd[];;
evaluation failed     hd

#hd[] ? `hd applied to empty list`;;
`hd applied to empty list` : string
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

The sessions  above  are enough  to give  a feel  for \ML.   For  a much longer
example, which illustrates most of the main features  of the  language, see the
introduction to \ML\ in  \DESCRIPTION.

In the  next chapter,  the logic  supported by  the \HOL\  system (higher order
logic) will be introduced, together with the tools in \ML\ for manipulating it.
