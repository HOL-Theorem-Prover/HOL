\chapter{The HOL Logic}
\label{HOLlogic}

The \HOL\  system  supports {\it  higher order  logic}.   This is  a version of
predicate calculus with three main extensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Variables can range over functions and predicates
(hence `higher order').
\item The logic is {\it typed}.
\item There is no separate syntactic category of {\it formulae\/}
(terms of type \ml{bool} fulfill their role).
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of higher order logic}

It is assumed the reader is familiar with predicate logic.  The syntax
and semantics of the particular logical system supported by \HOL\ is
described in detail in \DESCRIPTION.  The table below summarizes the
notation used.

Terms of the \HOL\ logic are represented in \ML\ by an {\it abstract
type\/}\footnote{Abstract types appear to  the user  as primitive  types with a
collection of operations; they are described in
\DESCRIPTION} called {\small\verb%term%}. They are normally input between
quotation marks, and anything between a pair of quotation symbols is parsed as
a logical term.   For example, the expression {\small\verb%"x /\ y ==> z"%}
evaluates in \ML\ to a term representing
{\small\verb%x%}$\wedge${\small\verb%y%}$\Rightarrow${\small\verb%z%}.  Terms
can be manipulated by various built-in \ML\ functions. For  example, the \ML\
function \ml{dest\_imp} with \ML\ type {\small\verb%term -> term # term%}
splits an implication into a pair of terms consisting of its antecedent and
consequent, and the \ML\ function \ml{dest\_conj} of type
{\small\verb%term -> term * term%} splits a conjunction into its two conjuncts.

\setcounter{sessioncount}{1}
\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#"x /\ y ==> z";;
"x /\ y ==> z" : term

#dest_imp it;;
("x /\ y", "z") : (term # term)

#dest_conj(fst it);;
("x", "y") : (term # term)
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

Terms of the \HOL\ logic are quite similar to \ML\ expressions, and this can at
first be confusing.  Indeed, terms of the logic have types similar  to those of
\ML\ expressions.   For example,  {\small\verb%"(1,2)"%} is  an \ML\ expression
with \ML\ type {\small\verb%term%}.  The \HOL\ type of this term is
{\small\verb%num#num%}.  By contrast, the \ML\ expression
{\small\verb%("1","2")%} has type {\small\verb%term#term%}.

The types of \HOL\ terms form an \ML\ type called {\small\verb%type%}.
Expressions having the form {\small\verb%": %}$\cdots${\small\verb% "%}
evaluate to logical types.  The built-in function {\small\verb%type_of%}
has \ML\ type {\small\verb%term->type%} and returns the logical type of a
term.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#"(1,2)";;
"1,2" : term

#type_of it;;
":num # num" : type

#("1","2");;
("1", "2") : (term # term)

#type_of(fst it);;
":num" : type
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

To try to minimise confusion between the logical types of \HOL\ terms and
the \ML\ types of \ML\ expressions, the former will be referred to as {\it object
language types\/} and the latter as {\it meta-language types\/}.  For example,
{\small\verb%"(1,T)"%} is an \ML\ expression that has meta-language type
{\small\verb%term%} and evaluates to a term with object language type
{\small\verb%":num#bool"%}.


\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#"(1,T)";;
"1,T" : term

#type_of it;;
":num # bool" : type
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

\HOL\ terms can be input using explicit {\it quotation\/}, as above, or
they can be constructed using \ML\ constructor functions. The function
{\small\verb%mk_var%} constructs a variable from a string and a type.  In
the example below, three variables of type {\small\verb%bool%} are
constructed.  These are used later.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#let x = mk_var(`x`,":bool")
#and y = mk_var(`y`,":bool")
#and z = mk_var(`z`,":bool");;
x = "x" : term
y = "y" : term
z = "z" : term
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

The constructors {\small\verb%mk_conj%} and {\small\verb%mk_imp%} construct
conjunctions and implications respectively.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
#let t = mk_imp(mk_conj(x,y),z);;
t = "x /\ y ==> z" : term
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

\section{Terms}

There are only four different kinds of terms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variables.
\item Constants.
\item Function applications: \ml{"$t_1$\ $t_2$"}.
\item $\lambda$-abstractions: {\small\verb%"\%}$x$\ml{.}$t$\ml{"}.
\end{enumerate}

Both variables and constants have a name and a type; the difference is that
constants cannot be bound by quantifiers, and their type is fixed when they are
declared (see below). The type checking algorithm uses the types of constants to
infer the types of variables in the same quotation. If there is not enough type
information a type checking error results:


\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"~x";;
"~x" : term

#"x";;
Indeterminate types:  "x:?"

evaluation failed     types indeterminate in quotation
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

In the first case, the \HOL\ type checker  used the  known type \ml{bool->bool}
of {\small\verb%~%}  to  deduce  that  the  variable  \ml{x}   must  have  type
\ml{bool}.  In the second case, it cannot deduce the type of \ml{x}.  Unlike in
\ML, there must be  enough information  in a  quotation to  fully determine the
type of  all  subterms.    The  default  `scope'  of type  information for type
checking is a single quotation, so a  type in  one quotation  cannot affect the
type-checking of another.  This scoping can be altered by using the {\it sticky
type\/} facility, which can be used to give default types to variables (see the
appropriate section  of  \DESCRIPTION\ for  details).   If there  is not enough
contextually-determined type information to resolve the types  of all variables
in a quotation, then it is necessary to explicitly indicate  the required types
by using \ml{"$term$:$type$"} as illustrated below.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"x:num";;
"x" : term

#type_of it;;
":num" : type
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

Functions have types of the form \ml{$\sigma_1$->$\sigma_2$}, where
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the types of the domain and range of the function,
respectively.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#type_of "==>";;
":bool -> (bool -> bool)" : type

#type_of "+";;
":num -> (num -> num)" : type
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent Both \ml{+} and \ml{==>} are infixes.  The  session below illustrates
this; it also illustrates object language versus meta-language types.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"(x+1), (t1==>t2)";;
"x + 1,(t1 ==> t2)" : term

#type_of it;;
":num # bool" : type

#"x=1","t1==>t2";;
("x = 1", "t1 ==> t2") : (term # term)

#type_of(fst it), type_of(snd it);;
(":bool", ":bool") : (type # type)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent The types of constants are declared in {\it theories}; this is
described in Section~\ref{theories}.

An application $t_1\ t_2$ is badly typed if $t_1$ is not a function:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"1 2";;
Badly typed application of:  "1"
   which has type:           ":num"
to the argument term:        "2"
   which has type:           ":num"

evaluation failed     mk_comb in quotation
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent or if it is a function, but $t_2$ is not in its range:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"~1";;
Badly typed application of:  "$~"
   which has type:           ":bool -> bool"
to the argument term:        "1"
   which has type:           ":num"

evaluation failed     mk_comb in quotation
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

The dollar in front of {\small\verb%~%} indicates that the constant has a special
syntactic status (in this case a non-standard precedence). Putting
{\small\verb%$%} in front of any symbol causes the parser to ignore any special
syntactic status (like being an infix) it might have.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"$==> t1 t2";;
"t1 ==> t2" : term
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

Lambda-terms, or $\lambda$-terms, denote functions. The
symbol `{\small\verb%\%}'
is used as an {\small ASCII} approximation to $\lambda$.
Thus `{\small\verb%\%}$x$\ml{.}$t$' should be read
as `$\lquant{x}t$'. For example,
{\small\verb%"\x. x+1"%} is a term that denotes the function
$n\mapsto n{+}1$.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#"\x.x+1";;
"\x. x + 1" : term

#type_of it;;
":num -> num" : type
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\section{Theories}
\label{theories}

The result of a session with the \HOL\ system is an object called a {\it
theory\/}.  This object is closely related to what a logician would call a
theory, but there are some differences arising from the needs of mechanical
proof.  A \HOL\ theory, like a logician's theory, contains sets of types,
constants, definitions and axioms.  In addition, however, a \HOL\ theory
contains an explicit list of theorems that have been proved from the axioms
and definitions. Logicians normally do not need to distinguish theorems that
have actually been proved from those that could be proved, hence they do not
normally consider sets of proven theorems as part of a theory; rather, they
take the theorems of a theory to be the (often infinite) set of all
consequences of the axioms and definitions.  Another difference between
logicians' theories and \HOL\ theories is that, for logicians, theories are
relatively static objects, but in \HOL\ they can be thought of as potentially
extendable. For example, the \HOL\ system provides tools for adding to
theories and combining theories.  A typical interaction with \HOL\ consists in
combining some existing theories, making some definitions, proving some
theorems and then saving the resulting new theory.

The purpose of the \HOL\ system is to provide tools to enable well-formed
theories to be constructed.  All the theorems of such theories are logical
consequences of the definitions and axioms of the theory.  The \HOL\ system
ensures that only well-formed theories can be constructed by allowing
theorems to be created by {\it formal proof\/} only.

A theory is represented in the \HOL\  system as  a collection  of files, called
theory files.  Each file has a name of the form $name$\ml{.th}, where $name$ is
a string supplied by the user.

Theory files are structured hierarchically to represent sequences of extensions of
an initial theory called \ml{HOL}.
Each theory file making up a theory records
some types, constants, axioms and
theorems, together with
pointers to other theory files called its {\it parents\/}.
This collection of reachable files is called the {\it
ancestry\/} of the theory file. Axioms, definitions
and theorems are named in the \HOL\ system by two strings: the name of the theory
file where they are stored, together with a name within that file supplied by the
user.
Specifically,
axioms, definitions and theorems
are named by a pair of strings $\langle thy,name\rangle$
where $thy$ is the name of the
theory current when the item was declared and $name$
is a specific name supplied by the user (see the functions
\ml{new\_axiom}, \ml{new\_definition} \etc\ below).

A typical piece of work with the \HOL\ system consists in a number of sessions. In
the first of these a new theory, ${\cal T}$ say, is created by extending existing
theories with a number of definitions. The concrete result of the session will be a
theory file ${\cal T}$\ml{.th} whose contents are created during the
session and whose ancestry represents the desired logical theory.  In subsequent
sessions this theory is extended by proving new theorems which will be stored in
the file ${\cal T}$\ml{.th}. The logical meaning of these sessions is that a new
extension to ${\cal T}$ is created which replaces the old version.  Subsequent
pieces of work can build on (\ie\ extend) the definitions and theorems of ${\cal
T}$ by making it a parent of new theories.

There are two modes of working with \HOL:   {\it  draft mode\/}  and {\it proof
mode\/}.  In  draft  mode,  inconsistencies  can  be  introduced  by  asserting
inconsistent axioms,  but  in  proof  mode only  consistency preserving actions
(namely valid proof) can be done.  Draft mode is analogous to `super user mode'
in Unix, in that it gives access to dangerous facilities.   Everything that can
be done in proof mode can be done in draft mode, but not vice versa.

There is always a {\it current theory\/}, whose name  is given  by the function
\ml{current\_theory}.  This function maps the value void, written
`\ml{()}' in \ML, to a string giving the name of the current theory.
Thus the \ML\ expression
\ml{current\_theory ()} evaluates to a string giving the name of the current
theory.  Initially  \HOL\  is in  proof mode  with current theory
called \ml{HOL}.  So evaluating \ml{current\_theory ()} immediately after
initiating a \HOL\ session gives the value \ml{`HOL`}, as can be seen in
the session shown below:


\setcounter{sessioncount}{1}
\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
% hol

          _  _    __    _      __    __

          Version 2.0, built on Sep 1 1991

#current_theory();;
`HOL` : string

#
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

Executing \ml{new\_theory`$thy$`} creates a new  theory called  $thy$; it fails
if there already exists a file $thy$\ml{.th} in the current working
directory (or in any directory on the current \HOL\ {\it search path\/},
for a description of  which, see  the appropriate  section of
\DESCRIPTION).

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_theory `Peano`;;
() : void
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent This starts a theory called \ml{Peano},  which is  to be  made into a
theory containing Peano's postulates as axioms for the natural
numbers.\footnote{An elaborate theory of numbers is built into \HOL, in which
Peano's postulates  are  in  fact  derived  theorems rather  than postulated as
axioms.}  These postulates, stated informally, are:

\begin{list}{{\small\bf P\arabic{Peano}}}{\usecounter{Peano}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{12mm}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{7mm}
\setlength{\labelwidth}{6mm}
\setlength{\labelsep}{2mm}
\setlength{\listparindent}{0mm}
\setlength{\itemsep}{14pt plus1pt minus1pt}
\setlength{\topsep}{3mm}
\setlength{\parsep}{0mm}}

\item There is a number $0$.
\item There is a function \Suc\ called the successor function such that
if $n$ is a number then $\Suc \ n$ is a number.
\item $0$ is not the successor of any number.
\item If two numbers have the same successor then they are equal.
\item If a property holds of $0$, and if whenever it holds of a number then it
also holds of the successor of the number, then the property holds of all
numbers. This postulate is called {\it Mathematical Induction}.
\end{list}

To fomalize this in \HOL\ a new type is introduced called \ml{nat}:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_type 0 `nat`;;
() : void
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

In general \ml{new\_type}$\ n\ \ml{`\ty{op}`}$ makes \ty{op}
a new $n$-ary type operator in the current theory.
Constant types are regarded as degenerate type operators with no arguments, thus
the new type \ml{nat}
is declared to be a $0$-ary type operator. The type operator \ml{list} is
an example of a $1$-ary operator,
types built with \ml{list} are written as \ml{$\sigma\ $list}. The type
operator {\small\verb%prod%} is $2$-ary, types using it are written
as \ml{($\sigma_1$,$\sigma_2$)prod} (which can, in fact, be written as
$\sigma_1${\small\verb%#%}$\sigma_2$).

The axioms {\small\bf P1} and {\small\bf P2} can now be formalized by declaring
two new constants of type \ml{nat}
to represent $0$ and \Suc.

Evaluating \ml{new\_constant(`\con{c}`,}$\sigma$\ml{)} makes
$\con{c}$ a new constant of type $\sigma$ in the current theory.
This fails if:

\begin{myenumerate}
\item not in draft mode;
\item there already exists a constant named $\con{c}$ in the current
theory.
\end{myenumerate}

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_constant(`0`, ":nat");;
evaluation failed     new_constant -- 0 clashes with existing constant
\end{verbatim}\end{session}


The symbol \ml{0}
is already a constant of the built-in theory \ml{num}, and this prevents
us using it as a constant of our new theory. The symbol \ml{O} will be used
instead.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_constant(`O`,":nat");;
() : void

#new_constant(`Suc`, ":nat->nat");;
() : void
\end{verbatim}\end{session}



The \HOL\ type checker ensures that {\small\bf P1} and {\small\bf P2} hold.
{\small\bf P3} is now asserted as an axiom:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_axiom(`P3`, "!n. ~(O = Suc n)");;
|- !n. ~(O = Suc n)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent This creates an axiom in the current theory (\ie\ in \ml{Peano}) called
\ml{P3}. Axiom {\small\bf P4} can be declared similarly:


\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_axiom(`P4`, "!m n. (Suc m = Suc n) ==> (m = n)");;
|- !m n. (Suc m = Suc n) ==> (m = n)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

The final Peano axiom is Mathematical Induction:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_axiom(`P5`,"!P. P O /\ (!n. P n ==> P(Suc n)) ==> (!n. P n)");;
|- !P. P O /\ (!n. P n ==> P(Suc n)) ==> (!n. P n)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

To inspect the theory, the function \ml{print\_theory} can be used:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#print_theory `Peano`;;
The Theory Peano
Parents --  HOL
Types --  ":nat"
Constants --  O ":nat"     Suc ":nat -> nat"

  P5  |- !P. P O /\ (!n. P n ==> P(Suc n)) ==> (!n. P n)

******************** Peano ********************
#\end{verbatim}\end{session}

To end the session and write out the various declarations into the theory file
\ml{Peano.th} the function \ml{close\_theory} is used.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#close_theory();;
() : void

#quit();;
% ls Peano.th
Peano.th
%
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent The function \ml{quit} exits from the \HOL\ system.

The preceding session set up a theory called \ml{Peano}. It is usual
to include in `Peano arithmetic' axioms defining addition and multiplication.
To do this a new session can be started and the theory extended.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
% hol

          _  _    __    _      __    __

#extend_theory `Peano`;;
Theory Peano loaded
() : void
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent The two new axioms can now be added, but first constants \ml{add} and
\ml{mult} must  be  declared  to  represent  addition  and  multiplication (the
symbols \ml{+}  and  \ml{*}  are  already in  use).   These can  be declared as
infixes using \ml{new\_infix} instead of \ml{new\_constant}.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_infix(`add`,":nat->nat->nat");;
() : void

#new_infix(`mult`,":nat->(nat->nat)");;
() : void
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent Constants declared with \ml{new\_infix}
must have a type of the form
\ml{$\sigma$->($\sigma$->$\sigma$)}.

Axioms defining \ml{add} and \ml{mult} can now be defined.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_axiom
# (`add_def`,
#  "(!n. O add n = n) /\ (!m n. (Suc m) add n = Suc(m add n))");;
|- (!n. O add n = n) /\ (!m n. (Suc m) add n = Suc(m add n))

#new_axiom
# (`mult_def`,
#  "(!n. O mult n = O) /\ (!m n. (Suc m) mult n = (m mult n) add n)");;
|- (!n. O mult n = O) /\ (!m n. (Suc m) mult n = (m mult n) add n)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent The theory \ml{Peano} has now been extended to contain the new
definitions.

This example shows how a theory is set up. How to prove consequences of axioms and
definitions is described later. The \HOL\ system contains a built-in
theory of numbers called \ml{num} which contains Peano's postulates and a
(descendent)  theory \ml{arithmetic} containing the definitions of addition
(\ml{+}) and multiplication (\ml{*}) and other things.
In fact, Peano's
postulates are theorems not axioms in the theory \ml{num}. The primitive constants
\ml{0} and \ml{SUC} (corresponding to \ml{O} and \ml{Suc} in \ml{Peano}) are
{\it defined\/} in terms of purely logical notions.
In \HOL, {\it definitions\/} are a special kind of axiom that are
guaranteed to be consistent. The commonest (but not only) form of a definition is:

\[f\ x_1\ \ldots\ x_n = t\]

\noindent where $f$ is declared to be a new constant satisfying this
equation (and $t$ is a term whose free variables are included in the set
$\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$).  Such definitions cannot be recursive because, for
example:

\[ f\ x = (f\ x)+1 \]

\noindent would imply $0=1$ (subtract $f\ x$ from both sides)
and is therefore inconsistent. An example of a definition is:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#new_definition(`Double_def`, "Double x = x add x");;
|- !x. Double x = x add x
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent This definition both declares \ml{Double} as a new constant of the
appropriate type and asserts the defining equation as a definitional axiom.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#print_theory `Peano`;;

\end{verbatim}\end{session}


The use of axioms, as illustrated here, carries considerable  danger in general
because it is very easy to assert inconsistent axioms.  It is thus safer to use
only definitions.  At first sight this might appear impossible, but in fact all
of ordinary  mathematics  can  be  developed  from  logic  by definition alone.
Showing this was  the achievement  of Russell  and Whitehead  in their treatise
{\sl Principia  Mathematica}  \cite{Principia}.    A   theory  containing  only
definitions is called a {\it definitional theory\/}.   Many useful definitional
theories are built into the \HOL\ system, or available as libraries.  Examples
include theories of numbers  (both natural  numbers and  integers), sets, bags,
finite trees, group theory, properties of fixed points and more.  Libraries are
constantly being  added  to \HOL\  and users  are encouraged  to contribute new
theories to the library when they develop them.

\newpage % PBHACK

The theory of numbers built into \HOL\ is a definitional theory that defines
numbers logically. Peano's postulates are proved from the definitions of
the type \ml{num} and the constants \ml{0} and \ml{SUC}.
It follows from Peano's postulates that certain kinds of recursion equations are
equivalent to non-recursive definitions. There is a built-in theory called
\ml{prim\_rec} (for `primitive recursion') that supports this,
together with tools for automatically transforming recursion equations into
definitions. This is illustrated later but, for example, here are the built-in
definitions of \ml{+} and \ml{*}:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
#ADD;;
Definition ADD autoloaded from theory `arithmetic`.
ADD = |- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n))

|- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n))

#MULT;;
Definition MULT autoloaded from theory `arithmetic`.
MULT = |- (!n. 0 * n = 0) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) * n = (m * n) + n)

|- (!n. 0 * n = 0) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) * n = (m * n) + n)
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent This also illustrates how certain built-in definitions (and theorems)
are `autoloaded' from the theories where they are defined (\ml{arithmetic} in this
case).

The theory  \ml{arithmetic} contains  too many  pre-proved theorems  to show in
full, but  here are  the constants,  definitions, and  the first  two (out of
113) theorems.
