structure Help :> Help = struct

(* Help -- a simple Moscow ML library browser, PS 1995-04-30, 2000-04-22

Invoking `help s' has the following effect:

 (a) s is normalized to lower case
 (b) if s is the empty string, then the help browser is invoked with the
     message !welcome;
 (c) otherwise, if the term s appears in !specialfiles, then the browser
     is invoked with the file associated with s;
 (d) otherwise, if the term appears in one of the index files in
     !indexfiles, then the help system asks the user to choose which
     help file to load, in case there are several, and invokes the
     browser with that file;
 (e) otherwise, a standard error message is shown.

The help system looks for help files in the -stdlib and in the
directories in !helpdirs.

The browser can open a file on a specified line, attempting to center
that lines in the display (assuming the display can hold !displayLines
lines at a time).

The browser accepts several commands for moving forth and back in the
current file.

The browser's search facility cyclically searches (case-insensitive)
for occurrences of a given string and displays the line in which the
string was found, as close to the center of the display (or portion
displayed) as possible.

Several hacks are being used to avoid loading too many other libraries
along with Help.
