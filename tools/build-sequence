# This file specifies the sequence of directories that the build
# program builds.  Each non-comment, non-blank line specifies a
# directory which will be visited by the build program.  Directories
# that are not absolute are interpreted with respect to the root of
# the HOL directory. Build is special-cased so that some directories
# are treated differently, but the default behaviour is that in each,
# it will call Holmake --qof.

# The **KERNEL** line stands for the directory containing the sytem's
# kernel, which may be selected as a command-line option to the build
# command (the possibilities are src/0, src/experimental-kernel, or
# src/logging-kernel as of 10 August 2012).

# Comments can be added; all text on a line after a # symbol is
# ignored.  Similarly blank lines are ignored.  If you are going to
# edit this file, be aware that it does not record various
# dependencies between the directories.  If dir1 is earlier than dir2,
# then dir1 can not depend on dir2, but if dir1 is later than dir2,
# then it may or may not depend on dir2.

# If a directory name is preceded by an !, then it will only be built
# if the -selftest flag is passed to Holmake, and the object files
# that it builds will not be transferred to the sigobj directory.  If
# there is more than one ! then the number of them indicates the level
# of -selftest required in order to get that directory to be built at
# all.  (If -selftest appears on its own, then that's level 1.  If you
# write -selftest 2, that's level 2, which means directories with 2 !s
# will get tested.)

# If a directory name is preceded by a string inside []-brackets, then
# that directory/target will only be considered if the string is the
# name of the current ML implementation.  Thus the line [poly]foo
# will cause foo to be built only if the current implementation is
# Poly/ML.  (The other supported implementation at the time of writing
# is [mosml].)
#
# If a directory name is preceded by a string inside ()-brackets, then
# that directory/target will only be considered if the string is the
# name of the current kernel.  Thus the line (otknl)foo will cause foo to
# be built only if the current kernel is otknl. (The other supported
# kernels at the time of writing are stdknl and expk.)
#
# If combining these annotations, the required order is [system] then
# (kernel) then test level.  Thus [mosml]!!foo, not !![mosml]foo, and
# [poly](otknl)!foo, not (otknl)[poly]!foo.
#
# Finally if a line begins with "#include" (without the quotes), then
# the file specified after the include directive is loaded and treated
# the same as if its contents had been inserted into the main file.
# Those files may include other #include directives. If the file is
# specified with a relative path, then it’s relative to HOLDIR/tools
# (the directory containing this file).
