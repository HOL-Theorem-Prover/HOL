   [subst (from,to,on)] substitutes to for from in on, replacing all
   occurrences found during a left-to-right scan, and doing the replacements
   as they are found.  (I.e., subst("aa", "b", "aaa") returns "ba", despite
   the fact that "aaa" arguably contains two occurrences of "aa".

   [pcsubst(s,pat)] replaces every unescaped occurrence of "%" in pat with
   s.

   [pattern_match pat obj] attempts to match the pattern pat against
   obj.  A pattern is any string containing at most one unescaped %
   character.  (% and backslash characters can be escaped by preceding
   them with a back-slash character.  Other <back-slash character>
   pairs are left as they are.  This treatment of quoting is not the
   same as GNU make's; it would leave trailing \\ alone.)  %
   characters match any non-empty substring.  The result is NONE, if
   there is no match, or SOME s, where performing pcsubst(s,pat) gives
   back obj.

   If pat doesn't contain a % character, return SOME "", which is otherwise
   impossible, because of the requirement that matches be over non-empty
   strings.

   [patsubst(from,to,on)] tokenizes argument on into a list of
   strings, and then attempts to match pattern from against each.
   Where the pattern matches with SOME stem, that element of the list
   is replaced with pcsubst(stem,to).  Those elements that don't match
   are left alone.  The resulting list is sewn back together with
   single spaces.

   [tokenize s] returns the list of white-space separated components
   in s, but taking heed not to treat back-slash quoted spaces as
   white-space.  It preserves all quoting within the "tokens", meaning
   that spacify (tokenize sl) = sl, except that multiple spaces or
   TABs between tokens in sl will have been compressed into just one
   space on the LHS.

   [find_unescaped clist ss] searches ss for an unescaped occurrence of one
   of the elements clist.  If it returns SOME i, then sub(ss, i) is the
   first such character.  If it returns NONE, then there is no such
   character.

   [wildcard s] treats s as a "shell glob" pattern and matches it
   against files in the current hierarchy (i.e., relative file names
   are assessed against the current directory). The list of all files
   that match are returned. If the pattern doesn't match any files,
   the string is returned as is.

   [function_call(fnname, args, eval)] evaluates the internal function
   fnname when applied to arguments args.  These args are not
   evaluated to strings to allow for functions (like if) that don't
   necessarily look at all of their arguments.  Evaluation is provided
   by the eval function.
