## `REPEAT_GTCL` {#Thm_cont.REPEAT_GTCL}


```
REPEAT_GTCL : (thm_tactical -> thm_tactical)
```



Applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to a goal.


When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic, a theorem and a goal:
    
       REPEAT_GTCL ttl ttac th goal
    
`REPEAT_GTCL` repeatedly modifies the theorem according to
`ttl` till the result of handing it to `ttac` and applying it to the goal
fails (this may be no times at all).

### Failure

Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem
and the goal.

### Example

The following tactic matches `th`â€™s antecedents against the assumptions
of the goal until it can do so no longer, then puts the resolvents
onto the assumption list:
    
       REPEAT_GTCL (IMP_RES_THEN ASSUME_TAC) th
