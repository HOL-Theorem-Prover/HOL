## `CONJ_DISCH` {#Drule.CONJ_DISCH}


```
CONJ_DISCH : (term -> thm -> thm)
```



Discharges an assumption and conjoins it to both sides of an equation.


Given an term `t` and a theorem `A |- t1 = t2`, which is an equation between
boolean terms, `CONJ_DISCH` returns `A - {t} |- (t /\ t1) = (t /\ t2)`, i.e.
conjoins `t` to both sides of the equation, removing `t` from the assumptions
if it was there.
    
                A |- t1 = t2
       ------------------------------  CONJ_DISCH "t"
        A - {t} |- t /\ t1 = t /\ t2
    



### Failure

Fails unless the theorem is an equation, both sides of which, and the term
provided are of type `bool`.
