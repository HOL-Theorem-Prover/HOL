## `TRANS` {#Thm.TRANS}


```
TRANS : (thm -> thm -> thm)
```



Uses transitivity of equality on two equational theorems.


When applied to a theorem `A1 |- t1 = t2` and a theorem `A2 |- t2 = t3`, the
inference rule `TRANS` returns the theorem `A1 u A2 |- t1 = t3`.
    
        A1 |- t1 = t2   A2 |- t2 = t3
       -------------------------------  TRANS
             A1 u A2 |- t1 = t3
    



### Failure

Fails unless the theorems are equational, with the right side of the first
being the same as the left side of the second.

### Example

    
       - val t1 = ASSUME ``a:bool = b`` and t2 = ASSUME ``b:bool = c``;
       val t1 = [.] |- a = b : thm
       val t2 = [.] |- b = c : thm
    
       - TRANS t1 t2;
       val it = [..] |- a = c : thm
