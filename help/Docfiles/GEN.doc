\TYPE {GEN : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {x} and a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule
{GEN} returns the theorem {A |- !x. t}, provided {x} is a variable not
free in any of the assumptions. There is no compulsion that {x} should
be free in {t}.
{
      A |- t
   ------------  GEN "x"                [where x is not free in A]
    A |- !x. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {x} is not a variable, or if it is free in any of the assumptions.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how the above side-condition prevents
the derivation of the theorem {x=T |- !x. x=T}, which is clearly invalid.
{
   #top_print print_all_thm;;
   - : (thm -> void)

   #let t = ASSUME "x=T";;
   t = x = T |- x = T

   #GEN "x:bool" t;;
   evaluation failed     GEN
}
