\DOC TRY_CONV

\TYPE {TRY_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to apply a conversion; applies identity conversion in case of failure.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, failure.

\DESCRIBE

{TRY_CONV c t} attempts to apply the conversion {c} to the term {t};
if this fails, then the identity conversion is applied instead.  That
is, if {c} is a conversion that maps a term {t} to the theorem {|- t = t'},
then the conversion {TRY_CONV c} also maps {t} to {|- t = t'}. But if {c}
fails when applied to {t}, then {TRY_CONV c t} raises the {UNCHANGED}
exception (which is understood to mean the instance of reflexivity,
{|- t = t}).  If {c} applied to {t} raises the {UNCHANGED} exception,
then so too does {TRY_CONV c t}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though the {UNCHANGED} exception can be raised.
