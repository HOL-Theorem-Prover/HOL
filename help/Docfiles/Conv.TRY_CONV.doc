\DOC TRY_CONV

\TYPE {TRY_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to apply a conversion; applies identity conversion in case of failure.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, failure.

\DESCRIBE
{TRY_CONV c "t"} attempts to apply the conversion {c} to the term {"t"}; if
this fails, then the identity conversion applied instead.  That is, if {c} is a
conversion that maps a term {"t"} to the theorem {|- t = t'}, then the
conversion {TRY_CONV c} also maps {"t"} to {|- t = t'}. But if {c} fails when
applied to {"t"}, then {TRY_CONV c "t"} returns {|- t = t}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
