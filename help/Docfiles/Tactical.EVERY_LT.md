## `EVERY_LT`

``` hol4
Tactical.EVERY_LT : (list_tactic list -> list_tactic)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sequentially applies all the list-tactics in a given list of
list-tactics.

When applied to a list of list-tactics `[LT1; ... ;LTn]`, and a goal
`g`, the tactical `EVERY_LT` applies each list-tactic in sequence to
every subgoal generated by the previous one. This can be represented as:

``` hol4
   EVERY_LT [LT1;...;LTn] = LT1 THEN_LT ... THEN_LT LTn
```

If the list-tactic list is empty, the resulting list-tactic has no
effect.

### Failure

The application of `EVERY_LT` to a list-tactic list never fails. The
resulting list-tactic fails iff any of the component list-tactics do.

### Comments

It is possible to use `EVERY_LT` instead of `THEN_LT`, but probably
stylistically inferior. `EVERY_LT` is more useful when applied to a list
of list-tactics generated by a function.
