## `prove` {#Tactical.prove}


```
prove : term * tactic -> thm
```



Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic.


When applied to a term-tactic pair `(tm,tac)`, the function `prove` attempts to
prove the goal `?- tm`, that is, the term `tm` with no assumptions, using the
tactic `tac`. If `prove` succeeds, it returns the corresponding theorem
`A |- tm`, where the assumption list `A` may not be empty if the tactic is
invalid; `prove` has no inbuilt validity-checking.

### Failure

Fails if the term is not of type `bool` (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.
