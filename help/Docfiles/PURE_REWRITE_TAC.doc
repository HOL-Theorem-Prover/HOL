\DOC PURE_REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {PURE_REWRITE_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_REWRITE_TAC} behaves in the same way as {REWRITE_TAC}, but
without the effects of the built-in tautologies.  The order in which
the given theorems are applied is an implementation matter and the user
should not depend on any ordering. For more information on rewriting
strategies see {GEN_REWRITE_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{PURE_REWRITE_TAC} does not fail, but it can diverge in certain
situations; in such cases {PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} may be used.

\USES
This tactic is useful when the built-in tautologies are not required as
rewrite equations. It is sometimes useful in making more time-efficient
replacements according to equations for which it is clear that no extra
reduction via tautology will be needed. (The difference in efficiency
is only apparent, however, in quite large examples.)

{PURE_REWRITE_TAC} advances goals but solves them less frequently than
{REWRITE_TAC}; to be precise, {PURE_REWRITE_TAC} only solves goals
which are rewritten to {"T"} (i.e. {TRUTH}) without recourse to any
other tautologies.

\EXAMPLE
It might be necessary, say for subsequent application of an induction
hypothesis, to resist reducing a term {"b = T"} to {"b"}.
{
  #PURE_REWRITE_TAC[]([],"b = T");;
  ([([], "b = T")], -) : subgoals

  #REWRITE_TAC[]([],"b = T");;
  ([([], "b")], -) : subgoals
}
