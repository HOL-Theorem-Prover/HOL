## `PROVE_TAC` {#bossLib.PROVE_TAC}


```
PROVE_TAC : thm list -> tactic
```



Solve a goal with use of hypotheses and supplied lemmas.


An invocation `PROVE_TAC thl` attempts to solve the goal it is applied to
by executing a proof procedure that is semi-complete for pure first order
logic. The assumptions of the goal and the theorems in `thl` are used.
The procedure makes special provision for handling polymorphic and
higher-order values (lambda terms).  It also handles conditional
expressions.

### Failure

`PROVE_TAC` fails if it searches to a depth equal to the contents of
the reference variable `mesonLib.max_depth` (set to 30 by default, but
changeable by the user) without finding a proof.

### Comments

`PROVE_TAC` can only progress the goal to a successful proof of the
goal or not at all.  In this respect it differs from tactics
such as simplification and rewriting.  Its ability to solve
existential goals and to make effective use of transitivity theorems
make it a particularly powerful tactic.
