\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{ADD_CONV "m + n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m + n = s
}
where {s} is the numeral that denotes the sum of the natural
numbers denoted by {m} and {n}.

\FAILURE
{ADD_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m + n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ADD_CONV "75 + 25";;
|- 75 + 25 = 100
}
