## `index` {#Lib.index}


```
index : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> int
```



Finds index of first list element for which predicate holds.


An application `index P l` returns the index (0-based) to the first
element (in a left-to-right scan) of `l` that `P` holds of.

### Failure

If `P` doesnâ€™t hold of any element of `l`, then `index P l` fails.
If `P x` fails for any `x` encountered in the scan, then
`index P l` fails.

### Example

    
    - index (equal 3) [1,2,3];
    > val it = 2 : int
    
    - let fun even i = (i mod 2 = 0)
      in try (index even) [1,3,5,7,9]
      end;
    
    Exception raised at Lib.index:
    no such element
    ! Uncaught exception:
    ! HOL_ERR
    
    - index (equal 3 o hd) [[1],[],[2,3]];
    ! Uncaught exception:
    ! Empty
