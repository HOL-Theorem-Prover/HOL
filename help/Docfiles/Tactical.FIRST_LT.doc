\TYPE {FIRST_LT : tactic -> list_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic to the first goal in the goal-list that works.

\KEYWORDS

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of goals {gl}, an application of {FIRST_LT tac} to {gl}
will try to apply {tac} to each goal in {gl} in turn. If no goal lets
{tac} succeed, the whole application fails also. Otherwise, the first
goal on which {tac} succeeds will generate a (possibly empty) list of
new sub-goals. These new sub-goals are pushed onto the front of the
rest of {gl}.

\FAILURE
The application of {FIRST_LT} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
list-tactic fails if the goal list is empty, or if argument {tac}
fails on each goal in the list {gl}.

\EXAMPLE
{
> FIRST_LT CONJ_TAC [([], “p ⇒ q”), ([“a ∨ b”], “p /\ q”)]
val it = ([([“a ∨ b”], “p”), ([“a ∨ b”], “q”), ([], “p ⇒ q”)], fn):
  goal list * list_validation
}
