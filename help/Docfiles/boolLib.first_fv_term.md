## `first_fv_term` {#boolLib.first_fv_term}


```
first_fv_term : (term -> tactic) -> tactic
```



Applies a term-tactic to goal’s first free variable that makes it succeed


A call to `first_fv_term tmtac` applies the function `tmtac` to all of
a goal’s free variables. This generates a list of tactics, which is
then applied to the goal tactic-by-tactic (this is the action of the
tactical `MAP_FIRST`). The first application that succeeds (doesn’t
raise a `HOL_ERR`) is taken as the result. Later applications are not
attempted.

### Failure

Fails if there is no free variable `v` in the goal `A ?- g` that makes
the application `tmtac v (A?-g)` succeed.
