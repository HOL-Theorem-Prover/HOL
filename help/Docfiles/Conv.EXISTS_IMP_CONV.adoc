EXISTS_IMP_CONV : conv

SYNOPSIS
Moves an existential quantification inwards through an implication.

KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, implication.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {?x. P ==> Q}, where {x} is not free in
both {P} and {Q}, {EXISTS_IMP_CONV} returns a theorem of one of three forms,
depending on occurrences of the variable {x} in {P} and {Q}.  If {x} is free
in {P} but not in {Q}, then the theorem:

   |- (?x. P ==> Q) = (!x.P) ==> Q

is returned.  If {x} is free in {Q} but not in {P}, then the
result is:

   |- (?x. P ==> Q) = P ==> (?x.Q)

And if {x} is free in neither {P} nor {Q}, then the result is:

   |- (?x. P ==> Q) = (!x.P) ==> (?x.Q)




FAILURE
{EXISTS_IMP_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{?x. P ==> Q}, or if it is applied to a term {?x. P ==> Q} in which the
variable {x} is free in both {P} and {Q}.

SEEALSO
Conv.LEFT_IMP_FORALL_CONV, Conv.RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV.
