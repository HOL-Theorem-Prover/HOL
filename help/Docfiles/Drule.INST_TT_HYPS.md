## `INST_TT_HYPS` {#Drule.INST_TT_HYPS}


```
INST_TT_HYPS :
(term,term)subst * (hol_type,hol_type)subst -> thm -> thm * term list
```



Instantiates terms and types of a theorem.


`INST_TT_HYPS` instantiates types and terms in a theorem `thm`,
in the same way `INST_TY_TERM` does.
It also returns a list of the instantiated hypotheses, in the same order
as the uninstantiated hypotheses appear in the list `hyp thm`.

### Failure

`INST_TT_HYPS` fails under the same conditions as `INST_TY_TERM`.
