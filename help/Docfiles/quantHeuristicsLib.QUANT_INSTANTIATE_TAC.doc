\TYPE {QUANT_INSTANTIATE_TAC : quant_param list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
A tactic to instantiate quantifiers in a term using a given list of
quantifier heuristic parameters.

\DESCRIBE
This tactic is based on {quantHeuristicsLib.QUANT_INSTANTIATE_CONV}.
It tries to instantiate quantifiers. Free variables of the goal are
seen as universally quantified by this tactic. Therefore, it tries to
instantiate these free variables.
In contrast to {quantHeuristicsLib.ASM_QUANT_INSTANTIATE_TAC} this tactic
does not take the assumptions of the goal into account.
