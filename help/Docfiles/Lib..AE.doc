\TYPE {$ : ('a -> 'b) * 'a -> 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Right-associated infix function application operator

\DESCRIBE
Writing {f $ x} is another way of writing {f x}.

\FAILURE
Fails if {f x} would fail.

\COMMENTS
Because {$} is right-associated, this can be a convenient way to avoid
parentheses. For example,
{
   first_x_assum $ qspec_then ‘m’ $ qx_choose_then ‘z’ strip_assume_tac
}
instead of
{
   first_x_assum (qspec_then ‘m’ (qx_choose_then ‘z’ strip_assume_tac))
}
Note also that {$} is tighter than the various {THEN} infixes, so a
tactic such as the one above can be used in a proof without needing
protection by extra parentheses.
