## `compare` {#Type.compare}


```
Type.compare : hol_type * hol_type -> order
```



An ordering on HOL types.


An invocation `compare (ty1,ty2)` returns one of `{LESS, EQUAL, GREATER}`.
This is a total and transitive order.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - Type.compare (bool, alpha --> alpha);
    > val it = LESS : order
    



### Comments

One use of `compare` is to build efficient set or dictionary
datastructures involving HOL types in the keys.

There is also a `Term.compare`.
