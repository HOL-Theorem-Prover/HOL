## `Raise` {#Feedback.Raise}


```
Raise : exn -> 'a
```



Print an exception before re-raising it.


The `Raise` function prints out information about its argument exception
before re-raising it. It uses the value of `ERR_to_string` to format the
message, and prints the information on the `outstream` held in
`ERR_outstream`.

### Failure

Never fails, since it always succeeds in raising the supplied exception.

### Example

    
    - Raise (mk_HOL_ERR "Foo" "bar" "incomprehensible input");
    
    Exception raised at Foo.bar:
    incomprehensible input
    ! Uncaught exception:
    ! HOL_ERR
