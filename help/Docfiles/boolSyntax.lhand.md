## `lhand` {#boolSyntax.lhand}


```
lhand : term -> term
```



Returns the left-hand argument of a binary application.


A call to `lhand t` returns `x` in those situations where `t` is of
the form ``` ``f x y`` ```.

### Failure

Fails if the argument is not of the required form.

### Example

    
    - lhand ``3 + 2``;
    > val it = ``3`` : term
    

### Comments

The name `lhand` is an abbreviation of “left-hand”, but `rand` is
so-named as an abbreviation of “operand”.  Nonetheless, `rand` does
return the right-hand argument of a binary application.
