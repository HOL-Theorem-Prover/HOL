## `EXT_CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV` {#ConseqConv.EXT_CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV}


```
EXT_CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV : (thm list -> conv) list -> thm list ->
                          (thm list * thm list * thm list) ->
                          directed_conseq_conv

Applies `CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV` interleaved with conversions and rewrites.


`CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV` often results in theorems of the following form
    
       |- (!x. T) /\ (T /\ (T /\ T)) /\ (\x. P) y /\ T ==>
          something
    
The problem is that `CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV` applies consequence
conversions, but no normal convs or simplifications. This is changed
by `EXT_CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV`. `EXT_CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV` gets a list of
conversions and a list of rewrite theorems. Moreover there are the
parameters of `CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV`. It then applies these conversions
(e.g. `DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV`) and a `REWRITE_CONV` with the given theorem
list interleaved with `CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV`. As a result the theorem
above might look now like
    
       |- P y ==> something
