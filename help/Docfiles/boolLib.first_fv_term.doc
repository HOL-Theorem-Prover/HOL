\TYPE {first_fv_term : (term -> tactic) -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a term-tactic to goal's first free variable that makes it succeed

\KEYWORDS
term-tactic

\DESCRIBE
A call to {first_fv_term tmtac} applies the function {tmtac} to all of
a goal's free variables. This generates a list of tactics, which is
then applied to the goal tactic-by-tactic (this is the action of the
tactical {MAP_FIRST}). The first application that succeeds (doesn't
raise a {HOL_ERR}) is taken as the result. Later applications are not
attempted.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no free variable {v} in the goal {A ?- g} that makes
the application {tmtac v (A?-g)} succeed.
