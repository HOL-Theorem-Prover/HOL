## `PSELECT_ELIM` {#PairRules.PSELECT_ELIM}


```
PSELECT_ELIM : thm -> term * thm -> thm
```



Eliminates a paired epsilon term, using deduction from a particular instance.


`PSELECT_ELIM` expects two arguments, a theorem `th1`, and a pair
`(p,th2): term * thm`.  The conclusion of `th1` must have the form `P($@ P)`,
which asserts that the epsilon term `$@ P` denotes some value at which
`P` holds.  The paired variable structure `p` appears only in the assumption
`P p` of the theorem `th2`.  The conclusion of the resulting theorem matches
that of `th2`, and the hypotheses include the union of all hypotheses
of the premises excepting `P p`.
    
        A1 |- P($@ P)     A2 u {P p} |- t
       -------------------------------------  PSELECT_ELIM th1 (p ,th2)
                  A1 u A2 |- t
    
where `p` is not free in `A2`. If `p` appears in the conclusion of
`th2`, the epsilon term will NOT be eliminated, and the conclusion will be
`t[$@ P/p]`.

### Failure

Fails if the first theorem is not of the form `A1 |- P($@ P)`, or if
any of the variables from the variable structure `p` occur free in any
other assumption of `th2`.
