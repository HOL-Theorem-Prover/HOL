## `COND_CASES_TAC` {#Tactic.COND_CASES_TAC}


```
COND_CASES_TAC : tactic
```



Induces a case split on a conditional expression in the goal.


`COND_CASES_TAC` searches for a conditional sub-term in the term of a goal,
i.e. a sub-term of the form `p=>u|v`, choosing one by its own criteria if there
is more than one. It then induces a case split over `p` as follows:
    
                                 A ?- t
        ==============================================================  COND_CASES_TAC
         A u {p} ?- t[u/(p=>u|v),T/p]   A u {~p} ?- t[v/(p=>u|v),F/p]
    
where `p` is not a constant, and the term `p=>u|v` is free in `t`.
Note that it both enriches the assumptions and inserts the assumed value into
the conditional.

### Failure

`COND_CASES_TAC` fails if there is no conditional sub-term as described above.

### Example

For `"x"`, `"y"`, `"z1"` and `"z2"` of type `":*"`, and `"P:*->bool"`,
    
       COND_CASES_TAC ([], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
       ([(["P y"], "x = z1"); (["~P y"], "x = z2")], -) : subgoals
    
but it fails, for example, if `"y"` is not free in the
term part of the goal:
    
       COND_CASES_TAC ([], "!y. x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
       evaluation failed     COND_CASES_TAC
    
In contrast, `ASM_CASES_TAC` does not perform the replacement:
    
       ASM_CASES_TAC "P y" ([], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
       ([(["P y"], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)"); (["~P y"], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)")],
        -)
       : subgoals
    




Useful for case analysis and replacement in one step, when there is a
conditional sub-term in the term part of the goal.  When there is more than
one such sub-term and one in particular is to be analyzed, `COND_CASES_TAC`
cannot be depended on to choose the ‘desired’ one. It can, however, be used
repeatedly to analyze all conditional sub-terms of a goal.
