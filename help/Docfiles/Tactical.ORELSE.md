## `ORELSE` {#Tactical.ORELSE}


```
op ORELSE : tactic * tactic -> tactic
```



Applies first tactic, and if it fails, applies the second instead.


If `T1` and `T2` are tactics, `T1 ORELSE T2` is a tactic which applies `T1` to
a goal, and if it fails, applies `T2` to the goal instead.

### Failure

The application of `ORELSE` to a pair of tactics never fails.
The resulting tactic fails if both `T1` and `T2` fail when applied to the
relevant goal.
