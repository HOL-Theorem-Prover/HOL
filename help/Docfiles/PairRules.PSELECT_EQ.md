## `PSELECT_EQ` {#PairRules.PSELECT_EQ}


```
PSELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)
```



Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.


When applied to a paired structure of variables `p` and a theorem
whose conclusion is equational:
    
        A |- t1 = t2
    

the inference rule `PSELECT_EQ` returns the theorem:
    
        A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)
    

provided no variable in `p` is free in the assumptions.
    
             A |- t1 = t2
       --------------------------  SELECT_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
        A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)
    



### Failure

Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation,
of if `p` is not a paired structure of variables,
or if any variable in `p` is free in `A`.
