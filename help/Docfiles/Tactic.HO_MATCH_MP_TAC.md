## `HO_MATCH_MP_TAC` {#Tactic.HO_MATCH_MP_TAC}


```
HO_MATCH_MP_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Reduces the goal using a supplied implication, with higher-order matching.


When applied to a theorem of the form
    
       A' |- !x1...xn. s ==> t
    
`HO_MATCH_MP_TAC` produces a tactic that reduces a goal whose conclusion
`t'` is a substitution and/or type instance of `t` to the corresponding
instance of `s`. Any variables free in `s` but not in `t` will be existentially
quantified in the resulting subgoal:
    
         A ?- t'
      ======================  HO_MATCH_MP_TAC (A' |- !x1...xn. s ==> t)
         A ?- ?z1...zp. s'
    
where `z1`, ..., `zp` are (type instances of) those variables among
`x1`, ..., `xn` that do not occur free in `t`. Note that this is not a valid
tactic unless `A'` is a subset of `A`.

### Example

The following goal might be solved by case analysis:
    
      > g `!n:num. n <= n * n`;
    
We can “manually” perform induction by using the following theorem:
    
      > numTheory.INDUCTION;
      - val it : thm = |- !P. P 0 /\ (!n. P n ==> P (SUC n)) ==> (!n. P n)
    
which is useful with `HO_MATCH_MP_TAC` because of higher-order matching:
    
      > e(HO_MATCH_MP_TAC numTheory.INDUCTION);
      - val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
    
      `0 <= 0 * 0 /\ (!n. n <= n * n ==> SUC n <= SUC n * SUC n)`
    
The goal can be finished with `SIMP_TAC arith_ss []`.

### Failure

Fails unless the theorem is an (optionally universally quantified) implication
whose consequent can be instantiated to match the goal.
