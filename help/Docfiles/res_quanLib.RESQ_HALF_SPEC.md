## `RESQ_HALF_SPEC` {#res_quanLib.RESQ_HALF_SPEC}


```
RESQ_HALF_SPEC : thm -> thm
```



Strip a restricted universal quantification in the conclusion of a theorem.


When applied to a theorem `A |- !x::P. t`, the derived inference rule
`RESQ_HALF_SPEC` returns the theorem `A |- !x. x IN P ==> t`, i.e., it
transforms the restricted universal quantification to its underlying
semantic representation.
    
          A |- !x::P. t
       --------------------  RESQ_HALF_SPEC
        A |- !x. x IN P ==> t
    

### Failure

Fails if the theorem’s conclusion is not a restricted universal quantification.
