\TYPE {REDUCE_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs arithmetic or boolean reduction on a goal at all levels possible.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
{REDUCE_TAC} attempts to transform a goal by applying {REDUCE_CONV}.
It will prove any true goal which is constructed from numerals and the boolean
constants {T} and {F}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may not advance the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The following example takes a couple of minutes' CPU time:

{
   > g ‘((1 EXP 3) + (12 EXP 3) = 1729) /\ ((9 EXP 3) + (10 EXP 3) = 1729)’;

   > e reduceLib.REDUCE_TAC;;
   OK..
   val it = 
      Initial goal proved
      ⊢ 1 EXP 3 + 12 EXP 3 = 1729 ∧ 9 EXP 3 + 10 EXP 3 = 1729 : proof
}
