## `PROVEHYP_THEN` {#Thm_cont.PROVEHYP_THEN}


```
PROVEHYP_THEN : (thm -> thm -> tactic) -> thm -> tactic
```



Makes antecedent of theorem as subgoal, continues with both parts as theorems.


An application of the tactic `PROVEHYP_THEN th2tac th` to a goal `g`
requires that `th` be an (universally quantified) implication
(or a negation, in which case `~p` is treated as `p ==> F`).
Given an implication `|- !x1..xn. l ==> r x1..xn`, the result is a new
sub-goal requiring the user to prove `l`, and the application of `th2tac`
to the theorems with conclusion `l` and `!x1..xn. r x1..xn`.

Diagrammatically, one might see this as
    
              A ?- g
       ==============================================  PROVEHYP_THEN th2tac th
       A ?- l  ...  th2tac (A |- l) (A |- r) (A ?- g)
    

### Failure

Fails if the theorem argument is not an implication or negation.

### Example

    
       > FIRST_X_ASSUM (PROVEHYP_THEN (K MP_TAC)) ([“p”, “p ==> q”], “r”)
       val it = ([([“p”], “p”), ([“p”], “q ==> r”)], fn):
                goal list * validation
    
The use of `FIRST_X_ASSUM` pulls out the first implicational theorem, and gives the user the requirement to prove `p` as a subgoal. In the other subgoal, `q` has become a new antecedent in the goal (thanks to the action of `MP_TAC`).
