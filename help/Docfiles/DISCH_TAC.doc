\DOC DISCH_TAC

\TYPE {DISCH_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves the antecedent of an implicative goal into the assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, undischarge, antecedent, implication.

\DESCRIBE
{
    A ?- u ==> v
   ==============  DISCH_TAC
    A u {{u}} ?- v
}
\noindent Note that {DISCH_TAC} treats {~u} as {u ==> F}, so will also work
when applied to a goal with a negated conclusion.

\FAILURE
{DISCH_TAC} will fail for goals which are not implications or negations.

\USES
Solving goals of the form {u ==> v} by rewriting {v} with {u}, although
the use of {DISCH_THEN} is usually more elegant in such cases.

\COMMENTS
If the antecedent already appears in the assumptions, it will be duplicated.
