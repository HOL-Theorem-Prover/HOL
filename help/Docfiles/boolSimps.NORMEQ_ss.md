## `NORMEQ_ss` {#boolSimps.NORMEQ_ss}


```
NORMEQ_ss : ssfrag
```



A simpset fragment that reorients equalities.


The `NORMEQ_ss` simpset fragment embodies a conversion that flips
terms of the form `l = r` when `l` contains no free variables, and `r`
contains at least one variable. To flip an equality is to rewrite it
so that `l = r` becomes `r = l`.

### Failure

As a static value, this cannot fail.

### Example

In this example, the simplifier flips the `3 = x` term, making it
useful as a rewrite when attacking the consequent of the implication.
    
       SIMP_CONV (bool_ss ++ boolSimps.NORMEQ_ss) [] ``(3 = x) ==> x + 1 < y``;
       > val it =
          |- (3 = x) ==> x + 1 < y <=> (x = 3) ==> 3 + 1 < y : thm
