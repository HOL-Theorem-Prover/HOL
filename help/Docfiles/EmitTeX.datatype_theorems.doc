\TYPE {datatype_theorems : string -> (string * thm) list}

\SYNOPSIS
All the datatype theorems stored in the named theory.

\DESCRIBE
An invocation {datatype_theorems thy}, where {thy} is the name of a currently
loaded theory segment, will return a list of the datatype theorems stored in
that theory. Each theorem is paired with the name of the datatype in the result. The string "-" may be used to denote the current theory segment.

\FAILURE
Never fails. If {thy} is not the name of a currently loaded theory segment,
the empty list is returned.

\EXAMPLE
{
- new_theory "example";
<<HOL message: Created theory "example">>
> val it = () : unit
- val _ = Hol_datatype `example = First | Second`;
<<HOL message: Defined type: "example">>
- EmitTeX.datatype_theorems "example";
> val it = [("example", |- DATATYPE (example First Second))] :
  (string * thm) list
}
