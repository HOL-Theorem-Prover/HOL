## `PTREE_DEFN_CONV` {#patriciaLib.PTREE_DEFN_CONV}


```
PTREE_DEFN_CONV : conv
```



Conversion for evaluating applications of `ADD` and `REMOVE` to Patricia tree constants.


Given a constant `c` defined using `Define_mk_ptree`, the conversion `PTREE_DEFN_CONV` will evaluate term of the form `c |+ (k,x)`, `c \\ k` and `c` where `k` is a natural number literal.

### Example

    
    - val ptree = Define_mk_ptree "ptree" (int_ptree_of_list [(1,``1``), (2, ``2``)]);
    <<HOL message: Saved IS_PTREE theorem for new constant "ptree">>
    val ptree = |- ptree = Branch 0 0 (Leaf 1 1) (Leaf 2 2): thm
    
    - PTREE_DEFN_CONV ``ptree \\ 1``;
    val it = |- ptree \\ 1 = Leaf 2 2: thm
    
    - PTREE_DEFN_CONV ``ptree |+ (3,3)``;
    val it =
       |- ptree |+ (3,3) =
       Branch 0 0 (Branch 1 1 (Leaf 3 3) (Leaf 1 1)) (Leaf 2 2):
       thm
    

### Comments

The conversion `PTREE_DEFN_CONV` has limited uses and is mostly used internally by the conversion `PTREE_CONV`.
