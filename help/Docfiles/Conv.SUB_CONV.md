## `SUB_CONV` {#Conv.SUB_CONV}


```
SUB_CONV : conv -> conv
```



Applies a conversion to the top-level subterms of a term.


For any conversion `c`, the function returned by `SUB_CONV c` is a
conversion that applies `c` to all the top-level subterms of a term.
Its implementation is
    
      fun SUB_CONV c = TRY_CONV (COMB_CONV c ORELSEC ABS_CONV c)
    

### Example

If the conversion `c` maps `t` to `|- t = t'`, then `SUB_CONV c` maps
an abstraction ``` ``\x.t`` ``` to the theorem:
    
       |- (\x.t) = (\x.t')
    
That is, ``` SUB_CONV c ``\x.t`` ``` applies `c` to the body of the
abstraction ``` ``\x.t`` ```.  If `c` is a conversion that maps ``` ``t1`` ``` to the
theorem `|- t1 = t1'` and ``` ``t2`` ``` to the theorem `|- t2 = t2'`, then
the conversion `SUB_CONV c` maps an application ``` ``t1 t2`` ``` to the
theorem:
    
       |- (t1 t2) = (t1' t2')
    
That is, ``` SUB_CONV c ``t1 t2`` ``` applies `c` to the both the operator
`t1` and the operand `t2` of the application ``` ``t1 t2`` ```.  Finally, for
any conversion `c`, the function returned by `SUB_CONV c` acts as the
identity conversion on variables and constants.  That is, if ``` ``t`` ``` is
a variable or constant, then ``` SUB_CONV c ``t`` ``` raises the `UNCHANGED` exception.

### Failure

`SUB_CONV c tm` fails if `tm` is an abstraction ``` ``\x.t`` ``` and the
conversion `c` fails when applied to `t`, or if `tm` is an application
``` ``t1 t2`` ``` and the conversion `c` fails when applied to either `t1` or
`t2`.  The function returned by `SUB_CONV c` may also fail if the ML
function `c:term->thm` is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function
that maps a term `t` to a theorem `|- t = t'`).
