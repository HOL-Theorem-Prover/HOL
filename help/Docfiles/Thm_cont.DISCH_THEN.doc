\DOC DISCH_THEN

\TYPE {DISCH_THEN : (thm_tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Undischarges an antecedent of an implication and passes it to a theorem-tactic.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, undischarge, antecedent, implication.

\DESCRIBE
{DISCH_THEN} removes the antecedent and then creates a theorem by {ASSUME}ing
it. This new theorem is passed to the theorem-tactic given as {DISCH_THEN}'s
argument. The consequent tactic is then applied. Thus:
{
   DISCH_THEN f (asl, t1 ==> t2) = f(ASSUME t1) (asl,t2)
}
For example, if
{
    A ?- t
   ========  f (ASSUME u)
    B ?- v
}
then
{
    A ?- u ==> t
   ==============  DISCH_THEN f
       B ?- v
}
Note that {DISCH_THEN} treats {~u} as {u ==> F}.

\FAILURE
{DISCH_THEN} will fail for goals which are not implications or negations.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how {DISCH_THEN} can be used to preprocess an antecedent
before adding it to the assumptions.
{
    A ?- (x = y) ==> t
   ====================  DISCH_THEN (ASSUME_TAC o SYM)
     A u {y = x} ?- t
}
In many cases, it is possible to use an antecedent and then throw it
away:
{
    A ?- (x = y) ==> t x
   ======================  DISCH_THEN (\th. PURE_REWRITE_TAC [th])
          A ?- t y
}
