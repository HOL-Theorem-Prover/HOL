\SYNOPSIS
Reduces goal of equality of boolean terms to forward and backward implication.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, equality, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- t1 = t2}, where {t1} and {t2} have type {bool},
the tactic {EQ_TAC} returns the subgoals {A ?- t1 ==> t2} and
{A ?- t2 ==> t1}.
{
             A ?- t1 = t2
   =================================  EQ_TAC
    A ?- t1 ==> t2   A ?- t2 ==> t1
}
