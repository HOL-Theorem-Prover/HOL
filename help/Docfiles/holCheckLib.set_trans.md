## `set_trans` {#holCheckLib.set_trans}


```
set_trans :  (string * Term.term) list -> model -> model
```



Sets the transition system for a HolCheck model.


The transition system is supplied as list of (transition label, transition relation) pairs. Each label must be a unique string. Each relation must be a propositional term, in which primed variables represent values in the next state. The transition label "." is internally used as a wildcard that is expected to match all transitions, and is thus not allowed as a transition label, unless there is only one transition.

### Failure

Fails if the transition labels are not unique, or the transition list is empty, or the wildcard label is used with a non-singleton transition list, or any of the relation terms is not a quantified boolean formula (QBF).

### Example

For a mod-8 counter, we need three boolean variables to encode the state. The single transition relation can then be set as follows (assuming holCheckLib has been loaded):

    
    - val m = holCheckLib.set_trans [("v0", ``v0' = ~v0``), ("v1", ``v1' = (v0 \/ v1) /\ ~(v0 = v1)``),
    	             ("v2", ``v2' = (v0 /\ v1 \/ v2) /\ ~(v0 /\ v1 = v2)``)] holCheckLib.empty_model;
    > val m = <model> : model
    

where empty_model can be replaced by whatever model the user is building.

### Comments

This information must be set for a HolCheck model.
