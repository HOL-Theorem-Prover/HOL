## `ASM_SET_TAC` {#bossLib.ASM_SET_TAC}


```
ASM_SET_TAC : thm list -> tactic
```



Tactic to automate some routine set theory by reduction to FOL,
using the assumptions and the theorems given.


`ASM_SET_TAC` is identical in behaviour to `SET_TAC` except that
it uses the assumptions of a goal as well as the provided theorems.

### Failure

Fails if the underlying resolution machinery (`METIS_TAC`) cannot
prove the goal, or the supplied theorems (and the assumptions) are not
enough for the FOL reduction.
