## `REPEAT` {#Tactical.REPEAT}


```
REPEAT : (tactic -> tactic)
```



Repeatedly applies a tactic until it fails.


The tactic `REPEAT T` is a tactic which applies `T` to a goal, and while it
succeeds, continues applying it to all subgoals generated.

### Failure

The application of `REPEAT` to a tactic never fails, and neither does the
composite tactic, even if the basic tactic fails immediately.
