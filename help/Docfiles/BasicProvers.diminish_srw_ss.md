## `diminish_srw_ss` {#BasicProvers.diminish_srw_ss}


```
diminish_srw_ss : string list -> ssfrag list
```



Removes named simpset fragments from the stateful simpset.


A call to `diminish_srw_ss fragnames` removes the simpset fragments
with names given in `fragnames` from the stateful simpset which is
returned by `srw_ss()`, and which is used by `SRW_TAC`.  This removal
is done as a side effect.

The function also returns the simpset fragments that have been
removed.  This allows them to be put back into the simpset with a call
to `augment_srw_ss`.

The effect of this call is not exported to descendent theories.

### Failure

Fails with the `Conv.UNCHANGED` exception if the call would make no
change to the underlying simpset (i.e., if no name in `fragnames`
corresponds to a fragment in the stateful simpset. Apart from this, a
name can be provided for a fragment that does not appear in the
stateful simpset. In this case, the name is just ignored, and there
will be no corresponding fragment in the list that the function
returns.

### Example

    
    - SIMP_CONV (srw_ss()) [] ``MAP ($+ 1) [3;4;5]``;
    > val it = |- MAP ($+ 1) [3; 4; 5] = [4; 5; 6] : thm
    
    - val frags = diminish_srw_ss ["REDUCE"]
    > val frags =
       [Simplification set: REDUCE
        Conversions:
          REDUCE_CONV (arithmetic reduction), keyed on pattern  ``EVEN x``
          REDUCE_CONV (arithmetic reduction), keyed on pattern  ``ODD x``
          REDUCE_CONV (arithmetic reduction), keyed on pattern  ``PRE x``
          REDUCE_CONV (arithmetic reduction), keyed on pattern  ``SUC x``
        ...] : ssfrag list
    
    - SIMP_CONV (srw_ss()) [] ``MAP ($+ 1) [3;4;5]``;
    > val it = |- MAP ($+ 1) [3; 4; 5] = [1 + 3; 1 + 4; 1 + 5] : thm
    
    - augment_srw_ss frags;
    > val it = () : unit
    
    - SIMP_CONV (srw_ss()) [] ``MAP ($+ 1) [3;4;5]``;
    > val it = |- MAP ($+ 1) [3; 4; 5] = [4; 5; 6] : thm
