\DOC HALF_MK_ABS

\TYPE {HALF_MK_ABS : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a function definition to lambda-form.

\KEYWORDS
rule, definition.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t1 x = t2}, whose conclusion is a
universally quantified equation, {HALF_MK_ABS} returns the theorem
{A |- t1 = \x. t2}.
{
    A |- !x. t1 x = t2
   --------------------  HALF_MK_ABS            [where x is not free in t1]
    A |- t1 = (\x. t2)
}


\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a singly universally quantified equation whose
left-hand side is a function applied to the quantified variable, or if the
variable is free in that function.
