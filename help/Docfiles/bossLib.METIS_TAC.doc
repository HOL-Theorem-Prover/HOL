\TYPE {METIS_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs first-order resolution to try to prove goal

\KEYWORDS
Tactic, resolution.

\DESCRIBE
When {METIS_TAC ths} is applied to a goal {(asl,w)}, it attempts to
find a resolution proof that the provided theorems in {ths} and the
assumptions in {asl} together imply the goal in {w}. {METIS_TAC}
implements ordered resolution and as such its ability to reason about
equality is generally better than {MESON_TAC}'s.

\FAILURE
Fails if the underlying resolution machinery cannot prove the goal.
{METIS_TAC} may also consume more and more time, and more and more
memory as a search for a proof proceeds without ever explicitly
failing.

\COMMENTS
The alternative lower-case spelling {metis_tac} is also available for
this tactic from the {bossLib} structure. There is no ``metis''
entrypoint that allows one to ignore the assumptions (with ``meson'',
there is both {MESON_TAC} and {ASM_MESON_TAC}).
