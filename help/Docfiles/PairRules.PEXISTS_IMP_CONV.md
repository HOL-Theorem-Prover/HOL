## `PEXISTS_IMP_CONV` {#PairRules.PEXISTS_IMP_CONV}


```
PEXISTS_IMP_CONV : conv
```



Moves a paired existential quantification inwards through an implication.


When applied to a term of the form `?p. t ==> u`, where variables from `p`
are not free in both `t` and `u`, `PEXISTS_IMP_CONV` returns a theorem of one
of three forms, depending on occurrences of variable from `p` in `t` and `u`.
If variables from `p` are free in `t` but none are in `u`, then the theorem:
    
       |- (?p. t ==> u) = (!p. t) ==> u
    
is returned.  If variables from `p` are free in `u` but none are in
`t`, then the result is:
    
       |- (?p. t ==> u) = t ==> (?p. u)
    
And if no variable from `p` is free in either `t` nor `u`,
then the result is:
    
       |- (?p. t ==> u) = (!p. t) ==> (?p. u)
    



### Failure

`PEXISTS_IMP_CONV` fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
`?p. t ==> u`, or if it is applied to a term `?p. t ==> u` in which the
variables from `p` are free in both `t` and `u`.
