\TYPE {using : tactic * thm -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Specifies alternative theorem to use for given tactic

\DESCRIBE
The standard HOL environment has {using} an infix, so one writes 
{tac using thm}. Such a call stashes an encoding of {thm}’s name onto
the goal’s assumption list and then calls {tac}. If {tac} is aware of
the possibility, it can use this theorem instead of the theorem it
would usually consult. After {tac} completes, the implementation of
{using} removes the reference.

This is typically used with the tactics {Induct}, {Induct_on},
{Cases}, or {Cases_on} which consult the TypeBase to find the theorems
their underlying code requires.

\FAILURE
Fails if the specified theorem has no hypotheses, is polymorphic, and
cannot be found by reverse lookup in the theorem database (using
{DB.revlookup}). Also fails if the underlying tactic fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
Induct_on ‘l’ using SNOC_INDUCT
}
sets up an induction on the term {“l”} using the {SNOC_INDUCT}
principle (“structural induction from the back of the list”).

\COMMENTS
Tactics unaware of the possibility of the presence of augmented
assumption lists can behave strangely.
