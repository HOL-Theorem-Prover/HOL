\DOC string_of_int

\TYPE {string_of_int : int -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps an integer to the corresponding decimal string.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When given an integer, {string_of_int}
returns a string representing the number in standard decimal notation,
with a leading minus sign if the number is negative, and no leading
zeros.

\FAILURE
Never fails. The function is not available unless the hol88 library has been
loaded.

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since the author always got it backwards; use 
{int_to_string} instead. Likewise, {int_of_string} is not found in hol90; use 
{string_to_int}.
