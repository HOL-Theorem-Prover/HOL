\TYPE {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN : (thm_tactic -> term -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, selective.

\LIBRARY
pair

\SYNOPSIS
Conditionally strips a goal, handing an antecedent to the theorem-tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem-tactic {ttac}, a term {u} and a goal {(A,t)},
{FILTER_STRIP_THEN ttac u} removes one outer connective ({!}, {==>}, or {~})
from {t}, if the term being stripped does not contain a free instance of {u}.
Note that {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} will strip paired universal quantifiers.
A negation {~t} is treated as the implication {t ==> F}. The theorem-tactic
{ttac} is applied only when stripping an implication, by using the antecedent
stripped off. {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} also breaks conjunctions.

{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} behaves like {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN}, if the term
being stripped does not contain a free instance of {u}. In particular,
{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC} behaves like {FILTER_PSTRIP_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN ttac u (A,t)} fails if {t} is not a paired universally
quantified term, an implication, a negation or a conjunction;
or if the term being stripped contains the term {u} (conjunction excluded);
or if the application of {ttac} fails, after stripping the goal.

\USES
{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} is used to manipulate intermediate results
using theorem-tactics, after stripping outer connectives
from a goal in a more delicate way than {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN}.
