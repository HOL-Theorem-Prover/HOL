\TYPE {op THENL : tactic -> tactic list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a list of tactics to the corresponding subgoals generated by a tactic.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
If {T,T1,...,Tn} are tactics, {T THENL [T1,...,Tn]} is a tactic which applies
{T} to a goal, and if it does not fail, applies the tactics {T1,...,Tn} to the
corresponding subgoals, unless {T} completely solves the goal.

\FAILURE
The application of {THENL} to a tactic and tactic list never fails.
The resulting tactic fails if {T} fails when applied to the goal, or if
the goal list is not empty and its length is not the same as that of the
tactic list, or finally if {Ti} fails when applied to the {i}'th subgoal
generated by {T}.

\USES
Applying different tactics to different subgoals.
