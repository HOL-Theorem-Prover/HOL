## `op_intersect` {#Lib.op_intersect}


```
op_intersect : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
```



Computes the intersection of two ‘sets’.


`op_intersect eq l1 l2` returns a list consisting of those
elements of `l1` that are `eq` to some element in `l2`.

### Failure

Fails if an application of `eq` fails.

### Example

    
    - op_intersect aconv [Term `\x:bool.x`, Term `\x y. x /\ y`]
                         [Term `\y:bool.y`, Term `\x y. x /\ z`];
    > val it = [`\x. x`] : term list
    



### Comments

The order of items in the list returned by `op_intersect` is not dependable.

A high-performance implementation of finite sets may be found in
structure `HOLset`.

There is no requirement that `eq` be recognizable as a kind of
equality (it could be implemented by an order relation, for example).
