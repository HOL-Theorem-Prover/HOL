\TYPE {tyvars : term -> type list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the type variables free in a term.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a term, {tyvars} returns a
list (possibly empty) of the type variables which are free in the term.

\FAILURE
Never fails. The function is not accessible unless the hol88 library has been
loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - theorem "pair" "PAIR";
  |- !x. (FST x,SND x) = x

  - hol88Lib.tyvars (concl PAIR);
  val it = [(==`:'b`==),(==`:'a`==)] : hol_type list

  - hol88Lib.tyvars (--`x + 1 = SUC x`--);
  [] : hol_type list
}


\COMMENTS
{tyvars} does not appear in hol90; use {type_vars_in_term} instead.
WARNING: the order of the list returned from  {tyvars} need not be the same as 
that returned from {type_vars_in_term}.

In the current HOL logic, there is no binding operation for types, so `is free
in' is synonymous with `appears in'.
