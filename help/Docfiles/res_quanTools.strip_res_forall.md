```
strip_res_forall : (term -> ((term # term) list # term))
```



Iteratively breaks apart a restricted universally quantified term.


`strip_res_forall` is an iterative term destructor for restricted universal
quantifications. It iteratively breaks apart a restricted universally
quantified term into a list of pairs which are the restricted quantified
variables and predicates and the body.
    
       strip_res_forall "!x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t"
    
returns `([("x1","P1");...;("xn","Pn")],"t")`.
