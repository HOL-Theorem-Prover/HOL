## `wlog_then` {#bossLib.wlog_then}


```
wlog_then : term quotation -> term quotation list -> thm_tactic -> tactic
```



Apply a theorem-tactic using a proposition that can be assumed without loss of
generality.


Like `wlog_tac`, but the theorem `P |- P` is passed to the user-provided
theorem-tactic instead of `strip_assume_tac`.

### Failure

Never fails when applied to a theorem-tactical. The resulting tactic fails if
and only if the user-provided theorem-tactical fails when used as a tactic
(i.e.: when applied to a theorem and a goal).
