\TYPE {FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Replace a theorem's type variables with fresh versions

\DESCRIBE
A call to {FULL_GEN_TYVARIFTY th} replaces (with {INST_TYPE}) the type
variables occurring in theorem {th}. The new type variables are
generated by successive calls to {gen_tyvar}, so should not have been
seen before.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The derived rule {GEN_TYVARIFY} will only instantiate those type
variables that are exclusively found in the conclusion. This is
reasonable when handling theorems derived from a tactic goal's
assumptions.
