## `THENL` {#Tactical.THENL}


```
op THENL : tactic * tactic list -> tactic
op THENL : list_tactic * tactic list -> list_tactic
```



Applies a list of tactics to the corresponding subgoals generated by a
tactic or a list-tactic.


If `T` is a tactic or list-tactic and `T1,...,Tn` are tactics,
`T THENL [T1,...,Tn]` is a tactic or list-tactic which applies
`T` to a goal or goal list, and if it does not fail,
applies the tactics `T1,...,Tn` to the corresponding subgoals,
unless `T` completely solves the goal(s).

### Failure

The application of `THENL` to a (list-)tactic and tactic list never fails.
The resulting tactic fails if `T` fails when applied to the goal(s), or if
the goal list is not empty and its length is not the same as that of the
tactic list, or finally if `Ti` fails when applied to the `i`â€™th subgoal
generated by `T`.


Applying different tactics to different subgoals.
