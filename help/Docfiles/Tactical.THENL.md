## `THENL`

``` hol4
op Tactical.THENL : tactic * tactic list -> tactic
op THENL : list_tactic * tactic list -> list_tactic
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applies a list of tactics to the corresponding subgoals generated by a
tactic or a list-tactic.

If `T` is a tactic or list-tactic and `T1,...,Tn` are tactics,
`T THENL [T1,...,Tn]` is a tactic or list-tactic which applies `T` to a
goal or goal list, and if it does not fail, applies the tactics
`T1,...,Tn` to the corresponding subgoals, unless `T` completely solves
the goal(s).

### Failure

The application of `THENL` to a (list-)tactic and tactic list never
fails. The resulting tactic fails if `T` fails when applied to the
goal(s), or if the goal list is not empty and its length is not the same
as that of the tactic list, or finally if `Ti` fails when applied to the
`i`'th subgoal generated by `T`.

Applying different tactics to different subgoals.
