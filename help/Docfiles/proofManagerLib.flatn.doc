\TYPE {flatn : int -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Flattens the tree structure of subgoals on the subgoal package goal stack.

\DESCRIBE
The function {flatn} is part of the subgoal package.
For a general description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

The {flatn} function's basic step of operation is to take the
the current list of sub-goals and concatenate it with the previous list of
subgoals (excluding the first of that list, from which the current list was
obtained).
The numeric argument passed to {flatn} specifies how many
times this operation is to be performed.

\FAILURE
Raises the {NO_PROOFS} exception if there is no current proof
manipulated by the subgoal package.

If {n} is too large, or negative,
the result will be a flat list of all subgoals.

\USES
To view, reorder, or attack simultaneously,
current and previously obtained subgoals.
