## `gen_new_specification` {#Definition.gen_new_specification}


```
gen_new_specification : string * thm  -> thm
```



Introduce a constant or constants satisfying a given property.


The ML function `gen_new_specification` implements the generalised primitive
rule of constant specification for the HOL logic.

Evaluating:
    
       gen_new_specification (name, [x1=t1,...,xn=tn] |- t)
    
simultaneously introduces new constants named `x1`,...,`xn`
satisfying the property:
    
       |- t
    
where the variables `x1`,...,`xn` in `t` are replaced by the new constants.

This theorem is stored, with name `name`, as a definition in
the current theory segment. It is also returned by the call to
`gen_new_specification`.

### Failure

`gen_new_specification` fails if any of the hypotheses of the input theorem are
not of the right form: they must be equations each with a variable on the
left-hand side and no free variables on the right-hand side. It also fails if
the supplied variables (equivalently, the desired constant names) `x1`,...,`xn`
are not distinct. Finally, failure occurs if the type of some `ti` does not
contain all the type variables occurring in the term `ti` itself.

### Comments

The generalised version is described in Rob Arthanâ€™s ITP 2014 paper, HOL
Constant Definition Done Right, available from
`http://www.lemma-one.com/papers/hcddr.pdf`.
