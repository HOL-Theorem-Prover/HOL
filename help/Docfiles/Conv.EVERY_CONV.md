## `EVERY_CONV` {#Conv.EVERY_CONV}


```
EVERY_CONV : (conv list -> conv)
```



Applies in sequence all the conversions in a given list of conversions.


`EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t"` returns the result of applying the conversions
`c1`, ..., `cn` in sequence to the term `"t"`. The conversions are applied in
the order in which they are given in the list. In particular, if `ci "ti"`
returns `|- ti=ti+1` for `i` from `1` to `n`, then
`EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t1"` returns `|- t1=t(n+1)`.  If the supplied list of
conversions is empty, then `EVERY_CONV` returns the identity conversion.  That
is, `EVERY_CONV [] "t"` raises `UNCHANGED`, which indicates the result `|- t=t`.

### Failure

`EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t"` fails if any one of the conversions
`c1`, ..., `cn` fails (other than by raising `UNCHANGED`)
when applied in sequence as specified above.
