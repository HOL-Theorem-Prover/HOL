PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)

SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once with only the given list of rewrites.

KEYWORDS
rule.

DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE} generates rewrites from the list of theorems
supplied by the user, without including the tautologies given in
{implicit_rewrites}. The applicable rewrites are employeded once, without
entailing in a recursive search for matches over the theorem.
See {GEN_REWRITE_RULE} for more details about rewriting strategies in
HOL.

FAILURE
This rule does not fail, and it does not diverge.

SEEALSO
Rewrite.ASM_REWRITE_RULE, Rewrite.GEN_REWRITE_RULE,
Conv.ONCE_DEPTH_CONV, Rewrite.ONCE_REWRITE_RULE,
Rewrite.PURE_REWRITE_RULE, Rewrite.REWRITE_RULE.
