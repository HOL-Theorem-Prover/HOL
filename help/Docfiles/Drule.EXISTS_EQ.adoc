EXISTS_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)

SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential, equality.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a variable {x} and a theorem whose conclusion is
equational, {A |- t1 = t2}, the inference rule
{EXISTS_EQ} returns the theorem {A |- (?x. t1) = (?x. t2)}, provided
the variable {x} is not free in any of the assumptions.

         A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------  EXISTS_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (?x.t1) = (?x.t2)




FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational with both sides having type {bool},
or if the term is not a variable, or if the variable to be quantified
over is free in any of the assumptions.
