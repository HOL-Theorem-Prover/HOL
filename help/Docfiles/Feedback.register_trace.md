## `register_trace` {#Feedback.register_trace}


```
register_trace : (string * int ref * int) -> unit
```



Registers a new tracing variable.


A call to `register_trace(n, r, m)` registers the integer reference
variable `r` as a tracing variable associated with name `n`.  The
integer `m` is its maximum value.  Its value at the time of
registration is considered its default value, which will be restored
by a call to `reset_trace n` or `reset_traces`.

### Failure

Fails if there is already a tracing variable registered under the name
given, or if either the maximum value or the value in the reference is
less than zero.
