## `apropos` {#DB.apropos}


```
apropos : term -> data list
```



Attempt to find matching theorems in the currently loaded theories.


An invocation `DB.apropos M` collects all theorems, definitions, and
axioms of the currently loaded theories that have a subterm
that matches `M`. If there are no matches, the empty list is returned.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - DB.apropos (Term `(!x y. P x y) ==> Q`);
    <<HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b>>
    > val it =
        [(("ind_type", "INJ_INVERSE2"),
          (|- !P.
                (!x1 y1 x2 y2. (P x1 y1 = P x2 y2) = (x1 = x2) /\ (y1 = y2)) ==>
                ?X Y. !x y. (X (P x y) = x) /\ (Y (P x y) = y), Thm)),
         (("pair", "pair_induction"),
          (|- (!p_1 p_2. P (p_1,p_2)) ==> !p. P p, Thm))] :
      ((string * string) * (thm * class)) list
    



### Comments

The notion of matching is a restricted version of higher-order matching.

For finer control over the theories searched, use `DB.match`.
