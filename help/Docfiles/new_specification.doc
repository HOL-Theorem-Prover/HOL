\SYNOPSIS
Introduces a constant or constants satisfying a given property.

\DESCRIBE
The ML function {new_specification} implements the primitive rule of
constant specification for the HOL logic.
Evaluating:
{
   new_specification {{name = "name", sat_thm = |- ?x1...xn. t,
                      consts = [{{const_name = "c1", fixity = f1}}, ...,
                                {{const_name = "cn", fixity = fn}}]}}
}
\noindent simultaneously introduces new constants named {c1}, ..., {cn}
satisfying the property:
{
   |- t[c1,...,cn/x1,...,xn]
}
\noindent This theorem is stored, with name {name}, as a definition in
the current theory segment. It is also returned by the call to
{new_specification} The fixities {f1}, ..., {fn} are values which
determine whether the new constants are infixes or binders or neither.
If {fi} is {Prefix} then {ci} is declared an ordinary constant, if it is
{Infix i} then {ci} is declared an infix with precedence {i}, and if it
is {Binder} then {ci} is declared a binder.

\FAILURE
{new_specification} fails if called when HOL is not in draft mode. It also
fails if there is already an axiom, definition or specification of the given
name in the current theory segment; if the theorem argument has assumptions or
free variables; if the supplied constant names {`c1`}, ..., {`cn`} are not
distinct; if any one of {`c1`}, ..., {`cn`} is already a constant in the
current theory or is not an allowed name for a constant.  Failure also occurs
if the type of {ci} is not suitable for a constant with the syntactic status
specified by the fixity {fi}.  Finally, failure occurs if some {ci} does not
contain all the type variables that occur in the term {?x1...xn. t}.

\USES
{new_specification} can be used to introduce constants that satisfy a given
property without having to make explicit equational constant definitions for
them.  For example, the built-in constants {MOD} and {DIV} are defined in the
system by first proving the theorem:
{
   th |- ?MOD DIV.
         !n. (0 < n) ==>
             !k. ((k = (((DIV k n) * n) + (MOD k n))) /\ ((MOD k n) < n))
}
\noindent and then making the constant specification:
{
   - val DIVISION = new_specification
                     {{name = "DIVISION",
                      consts = [{{fixity = Infix 650, const_name = "MOD"}},
                                {{fixity = Infix 600, const_name = "DIV"}}],
                      sat_thm = th}};

}
\noindent This introduces the constants {MOD} and {DIV} with the defining
property shown above.
