## `reset_trace` {#Feedback.reset_trace}


```
reset_trace : string -> unit
```



Resets a tracing variable to its default value.


A call to `reset_trace n` resets the tracing variable associated with
the name `n` to its default value, i.e., the value of the expression
`!r` when `n` was registered with `register_trace n r`.

### Failure

Fails if the name given is not associated with a registered tracing
variable, or if a `set` function associated with a "functional" trace
(see `register_ftrace`) fails.
