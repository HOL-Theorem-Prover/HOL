\DOC GEN_ALL

\TYPE {GEN_ALL : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem over its own free variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule {GEN_ALL} returns
the theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, where the {xi} are all the variables,
if any, which are free in {t} but not in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------  GEN_ALL
    A |- !x1...xn. t
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
WARNING: hol90 GEN_ALL does not always return the same result as GEN_ALL
in hol88. That is why GEN_ALL is in {hol88Lib}. Sometimes people write code
that depends on the order of the quantification. They shouldn't.
