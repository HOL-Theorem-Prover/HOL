\TYPE {ABS_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips lambda abstraction on both sides of an equation.

\LIBRARY
bool

\STRUCTURE
Tactic

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal of the form {A ?- (\x. M) = (\y. N)} (where {M}
and {N} may or may not mention their respective bound variables), the
tactic {ABS_TAC} strips away the lambda abstractions:
{
    A ?- (\x. f x) = (\y. g y)
   ============================  ABS_TAC
            A ?- f x = g x
}


\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal has the above form, namely an equation both sides of
which consist of a lamdba abstraction.

\COMMENTS
When the lambda abstractions' bound variables conflict with existing
free variables in the goal, variants of those names may occur in the
goal that results.
