## `CNF_CONV` {#normalForms.CNF_CONV}


```
CNF_CONV : conv
```



Converts a formula into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).


Given a formula consisting of truths, falsities, conjunctions,
disjunctions, negations, equivalences, conditionals, and universal and
existential quantifiers, `CNF_CONV` will convert it to the canonical
form:
    
    ?a_1 ... a_k.
      (!v_1 ... v_m1. P_1 \/ ... \/ P_n1) /\
      ...                                 /\
      (!v_1 ... v_mp. P_1 \/ ... \/ P_np)
    
The `P_ij` are literals: possibly-negated atoms. In first-order logic
an atom is a formula consisting of a top-level relation symbol applied
to first-order terms: function symbols and variables. In higher-order
logic there is no distinction between formulas and terms, so the
concept of atom is not well-formed. Note also that the `a_i`
existentially bound variables may be functions, as a result of
Skolemization.

### Failure

`CNF_CONV` should never fail.

### Example

    
    - CNF_CONV ``!x. P x ==> ?y z. Q y \/ ~?z. P z /\ Q z``;
    > val it =
        |- (!x. P x ==> ?y z. Q y \/ ~?z. P z /\ Q z) =
           ?y. !x x'. Q (y x) \/ ~P x' \/ ~Q x' \/ ~P x : thm
    

### Example

    
    - CNF_CONV ``~(~(x = y) = z) = ~(x = ~(y = z))``;
    > val it = |- (~(~(x = y) = z) = ~(x = ~(y = z))) = T : thm
