## `op_mk_set` {#Lib.op_mk_set}


```
op_mk_set : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list
```



Transforms a list into one with elements that are distinct modulo
the supplied relation.


An invocation `op_mk_set eq list` returns a list consisting of
the `eq`-distinct members of `list`. In particular, the result list
will not contain elements `x` and `y` at different positions such that
`eq x y` evaluates to `true`.

### Failure

If an application of `eq` fails when applied to two elements of `list`.

### Example

    
    - op_mk_set aconv [Term `\x y. x /\ y`,
                       Term `\y x. y /\ x`,
                       Term `\z a. z /\ a`];
    > val it = [`\z a. z /\ a`] : term list
    



### Comments

The order of items in the list returned by `op_mk_set`
is not dependable.

A high-performance implementation of finite sets may be found in
structure `HOLset`.

There is no requirement that `eq` be recognizable as a kind of
equality (it could be implemented by an order relation, for example).
