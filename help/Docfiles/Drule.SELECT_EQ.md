## `SELECT_EQ` {#Drule.SELECT_EQ}


```
SELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)
```



Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.


Effects the extensionality of the epsilon operator `@`.
    
           A |- t1 = t2
       ------------------------  SELECT_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
        A |- (@x.t1) = (@x.t2)
    



### Failure

Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation, or if the
variable `x` is free in `A`.

### Example

Given a theorem which shows the equivalence of two distinct forms of
defining the property of being an even number:
    
       th = |- (x MOD 2 = 0) = (?y. x = 2 * y)
    
A theorem giving the equivalence of the epsilon abstraction of each
form is obtained:
    
       - SELECT_EQ (Term `x:num`) th;
       > val it = |- (@x. x MOD 2 = 0) = (@x. ?y. x = 2 * y) : thm
