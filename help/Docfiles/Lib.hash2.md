## `##` {#Lib.hash2}


```
op ## : ('a -> 'b) * ('c -> 'd) -> 'a * 'c -> 'b * 'd
```



Infix combinator for applying two functions to the two projections of a pair.


An application `(f ## g) (x,y)` is equal to `(f x, g y)`.

### Failure

If `f x` or `g y` fails.

### Example

    
    - (I ## dest_imp) (strip_forall (Term `!x y z. x /\ y ==> z /\ p`));
    > val it = ([`x`, `y`, `z`], (`x /\ y`, `z /\ p`))
    



### Comments

The `##` combinator can be thought of as a map operation for pairs.
It is declared as a right associative infix.
