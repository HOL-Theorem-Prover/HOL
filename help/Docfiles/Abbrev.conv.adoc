conv = term -> thm

SYNOPSIS
The type of a function which 
finds an equal term and returns a theorem stating the equality

KEYWORDS
conversion.

DESCRIBE
If the function {c} is not only of the right type, 
but is actually what we call a conversion, then
{(c : conv) (t : term)} returns a theorem of the form

   |- t = t'

If (roughly speaking) {t} is of the right form to be passed to {c},
but {c} doesn’t find a desired equal term {t'}
then {c t} may raise the exception {UNCHANGED} in preference to returning
{|- t = t}, as it can be dealt with more efficiently.

SEEALSO
Conv.UNCHANGED.
