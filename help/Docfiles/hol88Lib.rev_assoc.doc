\DOC rev_assoc

\TYPE {rev_assoc : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a)}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches a list of pairs for a pair whose second component equals a specified
value.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
{rev_assoc y [(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)]} returns the first {(xi,yi)} in the list
such that {yi} equals {y}. The lookup is done on an eqtype, i.e., the SML 
implementation must be able to decide equality for the type of {y}.

\FAILURE
Fails if no matching pair is found. This will always be the case if the list
is empty.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - rev_assoc 2 [(1,4),(3,2),(2,5),(2,6)];
  (3, 2) : (int * int)
}

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since we use an option type instead of exceptions.

    assoc1;
    val it = fn : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> (''a * 'b) option
    - assoc2;
    val it = fn : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a) option
