\TYPE {SELECT_LT : tactic -> list_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic to the all the goals in the goal-list for which the
tactic succeeds.

\KEYWORDS

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of goals {gl}, an application of {SELECT_LT tac} to {gl}
will try to apply {tac} to each goal in {gl} in turn. If no goal lets
{tac} succeed, the goal state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the goals
for which {tac} succeeds will generate (possibly empty) list(s) of
new sub-goals. These new sub-goals are pushed onto the front of the
rest of {gl}.

\FAILURE
The application of {SELECT_LT} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
list-tactic also never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
> SELECT_LT CONJ_TAC [([], “r ∧ s”), ([], “p ⇒ q”), ([“a ∨ b”], “p ∧ q”)]
val it =
  ([([], “r”), ([], “s”), ([“a ∨ b”], “p”), ([“a ∨ b”], “q”), ([], “p ⇒ q”)], fn):
  goal list * list_validation
}
