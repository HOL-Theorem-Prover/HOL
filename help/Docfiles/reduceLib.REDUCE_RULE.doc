\SYNOPSIS
Performs arithmetic or boolean reduction on a theorem at all levels possible.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
{REDUCE_RULE} attempts to transform a theorem by applying {REDUCE_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may just return the original theorem.

\EXAMPLE
{
> reduceLib.REDUCE_RULE (ASSUME “x = 100 + (60 - 17)”);
val it = [.] ⊢ x = 143 : thm

> reduceLib.REDUCE_RULE (REFL “100 + 12 DIV 6”);
val it = ⊢ T : thm
}
