\DOC int_of_string

\TYPE {int_of_string : string -> int}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps a string of numbers to the corresponding integer.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. Given a string representing an integer in
standard decimal notation, possibly including a leading plus sign or
minus sign and/or leading zeros, {int_of_string} returns the
corresponding integer constant.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the string is a valid decimal representation as specified
above. It will not be found unless the hol88 library has been loaded.

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since the author always got it backwards; use 
{string_to_int} instead. Likewise, {string_of_int} is not found in hol90; use 
{int_to_string}.
