## `DEEP_INTRO_TAC` {#Tactic.DEEP_INTRO_TAC}


```
DEEP_INTRO_TAC : thm -> tactic
```



Applies an introduction-rule backwards; instantiating a predicate variable.


The function `DEEP_INTRO_TAC` expects a theorem of the form
    
       antecedents ==> P (term-pattern)
    
where `P` is a variable, and `term-pattern` is a pattern describing
the form of an expected sub-term in the goal.  When `th` is of this
form, the tactic `DEEP_INTRO_TAC th` finds a higher-order
instantiation for the variable `P` and a first order instantiation for
the variables in `term-pattern` such that the instantiated conclusion
of `th` is identical to the goal.  It then applies `MATCH_MP_TAC` to
turn the goal into an instantiation of the antecedents of `th`.

### Failure

Fails if there is no (free) instance of `term-pattern` in the goal.
Also fails if `th` is not of the required form.

### Example

The theorem `SELECT_ELIM_THM` states
    
       |- !P Q. (?x. P x) /\ (!x. P x ==> Q x) ==> Q ($@ P)
    
This is of the required form for use by `DEEP_INTRO_TAC`, and can be
used to transform a goal mentioning Hilbert Choice (the `@` operator)
into one that doesnâ€™t.  Indeed, this is how `SELECT_ELIM_TAC` is
implemented.
