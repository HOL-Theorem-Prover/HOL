\DOC MATCH_RENAME_TAC

\TYPE {Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC : term quotation -> string list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Replaces selected terms with new variables by matching a pattern against the goal statement.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to the goal {(asl, w)}, the tactic {Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC q ls}
parses the quotation {q} in the context of the goal, producing a term to use as
a pattern. The tactic then attempts a (first order) match of the pattern
against the term {w}.

For each variable {v} in the pattern, there will be an instantiation term {t},
such that the substitution {pattern[v1 |-> t1, v2 |-> t2, ...]} produces {w}.
The effect of the tactic is to then replace each {t} with the corresponding
{v}, yielding a new goal. The list {ls} is of exceptions: if a variable {v}'s
name appears in {ls}, then no replacement of {v} for {t} is made.

\FAILURE
{MATCH_RENAME_TAC} fails if the pattern provided does not match the
goal, or if variables from the goal are used in the pattern in ways
that make the pattern fail to type-check.

\EXAMPLE
If the current goal is
{
   ?- (f x = Pair C'' C0') ==> (f C'' = f C0')
}
then applying the tactic {Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC `(f x = Pair c1 c2) ==> X` ["X"]} results in
the goal
{
   ?- (f x = Pair c1 c2) ==> (f c1 = f c2)
}

\COMMENTS
This tactic is equivalent to first applying {Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC q}, then
applying {Q.RM_ABBREV_TAC `v`} for each {v} in {q} whose name is not in {ls}.
