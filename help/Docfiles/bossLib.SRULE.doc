\TYPE {SRULE : thm list -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplification with standard simpset as a derived rule

\KEYWORDS
simplification

\DESCRIBE
A call to {SRULE ths th} simplifies the theorem {th} using the
standard simpset (accessible through a call to {srw_ss()}) and the
theorems {ths}, returning the simplified theorem.

The implementation of {SRULE} is
{
   fun SRULE ths th = SIMP_RULE (srw_ss()) ths th
}
The fact that this definition is not eta-reduced means that partial
applications of {SRULE} will continue to pick up the current value of
{srw_ss()} when they are eventually fully applied, rather than bake in
the value from the time of the partial application.

\FAILURE
Should never fail.
