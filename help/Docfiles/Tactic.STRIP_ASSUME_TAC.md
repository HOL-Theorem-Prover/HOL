Splits a theorem into a list of theorems and then adds them to the assumptions.


Given a theorem `th` and a goal `(A,t)`, `STRIP_ASSUME_TAC th` splits `th` into
a list of theorems. This is done by recursively breaking conjunctions into
separate conjuncts, cases-splitting disjunctions, and eliminating existential
quantifiers by choosing arbitrary variables.  Schematically, the following
rules are applied:
    
               A ?- t
       ======================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 /\ ... /\ vn)
        A u {v1,...,vn} ?- t
    
                    A ?- t
       =================================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 \/ ... \/ vn)
        A u {v1} ?- t ... A u {vn} ?- t
    
              A ?- t
       ====================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- ?x.v)
        A u {v[x'/x]} ?- t
    
where `x'` is a variant of `x`.

If the conclusion of `th` is not a conjunction, a disjunction or an
existentially quantified term, the whole theorem `th` is added to the
assumptions.

As assumptions are generated, they are examined to see if they solve the goal
(either by being alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal or by deriving
a contradiction).

The assumptions of the theorem being split are not added to the assumptions of
the goal(s), but they are recorded in the proof.  This means that if `A'` is
not a subset of the assumptions `A` of the goal (up to alpha-conversion),
`STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A'|-v)` results in an invalid tactic.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

When solving the goal
    
       ?- m = 0 + m
    
assuming the clauses for addition with
`STRIP_ASSUME_TAC ADD_CLAUSES` results in the goal
    
      {m + (SUC n) = SUC(m + n), (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n),
       m + 0 = m, 0 + m = m, m = 0 + m} ?- m = 0 + m
    
while the same tactic directly solves the goal
    
       ?- 0 + m = m
    




`STRIP_ASSUME_TAC` is used when applying a previously proved theorem to solve
a goal, or
when enriching its assumptions so that resolution, rewriting with assumptions
and other operations involving assumptions have more to work with.
