\TYPE {GSYM : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a top-down search.

\KEYWORDS
rule, symmetry, equality.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {GSYM} reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a
top-down search of the conclusion of the argument theorem. An equation will be
reversed iff it is not a proper subterm of another equation. If a theorem
contains no equations, it will be returned unchanged.

}
\FAILURE
Never fails, and never loops infinitely.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ADD;;
|- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n))
Run time: 0.0s

#GSYM ADD;;
|- (!n. n = 0 + n) /\ (!m n. SUC(m + n) = (SUC m) + n)
