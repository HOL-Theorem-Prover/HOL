## `PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV` {#patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV}


```
PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV : conv
```



Conversion for evaluating applications of `patricia$EVERY_LEAF`.


The conversion `PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV` evaluates terms of the form `EVERY_LEAF P t` where `t` is a well-formed Patricia tree (constructed by `patricia$Empty`, `patricia$Leaf` and `patricia$Branch`) and `P` is predicate.

### Failure

The conversion will fail if the supplied term is not a suitable application of `patricia$EVERY_LEAF`.

### Example

    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (=) Empty``;
    > val it = |- EVERY_LEAF $= <{}> <=> T: thm
    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (\x y. (x < 3) ==> (y = 1)) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1))``;
    > val it =
       |- EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 3 ==> (y = 1))
            (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1)) <=> T:
       thm
    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 2) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1))``;
    > val it =
       |- EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 2) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1)) <=> F:
       thm
