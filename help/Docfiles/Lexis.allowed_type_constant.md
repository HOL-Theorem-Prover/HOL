## `allowed_type_constant` {#Lexis.allowed_type_constant}


```
allowed_type_constant : string -> bool
```



Tests if a string has a permissible name for a type constant.




When applied to a string, `allowed_type_constant` returns `true` if
the string is a permissible constant name for a type operator, and
`false` otherwise.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

The following gives a sample of some allowed and disallowed names for
type operators:
    
       - map Lexis.allowed_type_constant ["list", "'a", "fun", "->", "#", "fun2"];
       > val it = [true, false, true, false, false, true] : bool list
    



### Comments

Note that this function only performs a lexical test; it does not
check whether there is already a type operator of that name in the
current theory.

This function is not currently enforced by the system, as it was found
that more flexibilty in naming was preferable.
