\TYPE {assoc : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> ''a * 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches a list of pairs for a pair whose first component equals a specified
value.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
{assoc x [(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)]} returns the first {(xi,yi)} in the list such
that {xi} equals {x}. The lookup is done on an eqtype, i.e., the SML 
implementation must be able to decide equality for the type of {x}.

\FAILURE
Fails if no matching pair is found. This will always be the case if the list
is empty.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - assoc 2 [(1,4),(3,2),(2,5),(2,6)];
 (2, 5) : (int * int)
}

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since we use an option type instead of exceptions.

    assoc1;
    val it = fn : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> (''a * 'b) option
    - assoc2;
    val it = fn : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a) option
