## `CCONTR` {#Thm.CCONTR}


```
CCONTR : term -> thm -> thm
```



Implements the classical contradiction rule.


When applied to a term `t` and a theorem `A |- F`, the inference rule `CCONTR`
returns the theorem `A - {~t} |- t`.
    
           A |- F
       ---------------  CCONTR t
        A - {~t} |- t
    



### Failure

Fails unless the term has type `bool` and the theorem has `F` as its
conclusion.

### Comments

The usual use will be when `~t` exists in the assumption list; in this case,
`CCONTR` corresponds to the classical contradiction rule: if `~t` leads to
a contradiction, then `t` must be true.
