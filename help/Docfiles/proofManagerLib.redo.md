## `redo` {#proofManagerLib.redo}


```
redo : unit -> proof
```



Restores the proof state, redoing the effects of a previous expansion.


The function `redo` is part of the subgoal package.  It may be abbreviated by
the function `rd`. It undoes the action of `backup`, returning to a state after
an undone state change (caused by calls to `expand`, `rotate` and similar
functions). The function that caused the original state change is not re-run;
only the final state is restored. Any regular state change will cause the
redo stack to be discarded.

### Failure

The function `redo` will fail if the redo list is empty.

### Example

    
    - g `(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])`;
    > val it =
        Proof manager status: 1 proof.
        1. Incomplete:
             Initial goal:
             (HD [1; 2; 3] = 1) /\ (TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3])
    
         : proofs
    
    - e CONJ_TAC;
    OK..
    2 subgoals:
    > val it =
        TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3]
    
    
        HD [1; 2; 3] = 1
    
    2 subgoals
         : proof
    
    - backup();
    > val it =
        Initial goal:
    
        (HD [1; 2; 3] = 1) /\ (TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3])
    
         : proof
    
    - redo();
    > val it =
        TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3]
    
    
        HD [1; 2; 3] = 1
    
    2 subgoals
         : proof
    




Back tracking in a goal-directed proof to undo errors or try different tactics.
