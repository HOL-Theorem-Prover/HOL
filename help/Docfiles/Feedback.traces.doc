\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of registered tracing variables.

\KEYWORDS
Tracing.

\DESCRIBE
The function {traces} is part of the interface to a collection of
variables that control the verboseness of various tools within the
system. Tracing can be useful both when debugging proofs (with the
simplifier for example), and also as a guide to how an automatic proof
is proceeding (with {mesonLib} for example).

\FAILURE
Never fails.
