## `PRENEX_CONV` {#Arith.PRENEX_CONV}


```
PRENEX_CONV : conv
```



Puts a formula into prenex normal form.


This function puts a formula into prenex normal form, and in the process splits
any Boolean equalities (if-and-only-if) into two implications. If there is a
Boolean-valued subterm present as the condition of a conditional, the subterm
will be put in prenex normal form, but quantifiers will not be moved out of the
condition. Some renaming of variables may take place.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    > PRENEX_CONV ``!m n. (m <= n) ==> !p. (m < SUC(n + p))``;
    val it = |- (!m n. m <= n ==> (!p. m < (SUC(n + p)))) =
                (!m n p. m <= n ==> m < (SUC(n + p)))
    
    > PRENEX_CONV ``!p. (!m. m >= p) = (p = 0)``;
    val it = |- (!p. (!m. m >= p) = (p = 0)) =
                (!p m. ?m'. (m' >= p ==> (p = 0)) /\ ((p = 0) ==> m >= p))
    


Useful as a preprocessor to decision procedures which require their argument
formula to be in prenex normal form.
