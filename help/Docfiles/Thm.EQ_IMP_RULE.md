## `EQ_IMP_RULE` {#Thm.EQ_IMP_RULE}


```
EQ_IMP_RULE : thm -> thm * thm
```



Derives forward and backward implication from equality of boolean terms.


When applied to a theorem `A |- t1 = t2`, where `t1` and `t2` both have
type `bool`, the inference rule `EQ_IMP_RULE` returns the
theorems `A |- t1 ==> t2` and `A |- t2 ==> t1`.
    
                  A |- t1 = t2
       -----------------------------------  EQ_IMP_RULE
        A |- t1 ==> t2     A |- t2 ==> t1
    



### Failure

Fails unless the conclusion of the given theorem is an equation between
boolean terms.
