## `allowed_term_constant` {#Lexis.allowed_term_constant}


```
Lexis.allowed_term_constant : string -> bool
```



Tests if a string has a permissible name for a term constant.


When applied to a string, `allowed_term_constant` returns `true` if
the string is a permissible constant name for a term, that is, if it
is an identifier (see the DESCRIPTION for more details), and `false`
otherwise.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

The following gives a sample of some allowed and disallowed constant
names:
    
       - map Lexis.allowed_term_constant ["pi", "@", "a name", "+++++", "10"];
       > val it = [true, true, false, true, false] : bool list
    



### Comments

Note that this function only performs a lexical test; it does not
check whether there is already a constant of that name in the current
theory.
