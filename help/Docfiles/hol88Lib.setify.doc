\DOC setify

\TYPE {setify : ''a list -> ''a list}

\SYNOPSIS
{setify} makes a set out of an "eqtype" list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {setify l} removes repeated elements from
{l}, leaving the last occurrence of each duplicate in the list.

\FAILURE
Never fails. The function is not available unless the hol88 library has been 
loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - setify [1,2,3,1,4,3];
  [2,1,4,3] : int list
}


\COMMENTS
Perhaps the first occurrence of each duplicate should be left in the list, not
the last? However, other functions may rely on the ordering currently used.
Included in {hol88Lib} because {setify} has since been replaced by {mk_set}.

\SEEALSO
distinct.
