## `iffRL` {#Drule.iffRL}


```
iffRL : thm -> thm
```



Returns the right-to-left direction of a “guarded” iff theorem


A call to `iffRL th`, where `th` has the form
    
       A |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==> (l <=> r)
    
returns the right-to-left implication
    
       A |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==> r ==> l
    
The universal variables and various antecedents are said to “guard”
the if-and-only-if conclusion `l <=> r` in this situation. They may be
nested abitrarily deep, or not present at all. They are restored after
a call to `EQ_IMP_RULE` is made.

### Failure

Fails if the theorem is not of the form specified above.
