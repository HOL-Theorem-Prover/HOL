## `GEN_IMP` {#ConseqConv.GEN_IMP}


```
GEN_IMP : term -> thm -> thm
```



Generalizes both sides of an implication in the conclusion of a theorem.


When applied to a term `x` and a theorem `A |- t1 ==> t2`, the inference rule
`GEN_IMP` returns the theorem `A |- (!x. t1) ==> (!x. t2)`, provided `x` is a
variable not free in any of the assumptions. There is no compulsion that `x`
should be free in `t1` or `t2`.
    
              A |- (t1 ==> t2)
       ----------------------------     GEN_IMP x       [where x is not free in A]
        A |- (!x. t1) ==> (!x. t2)
    



### Failure

Fails if `x` is not a variable, the conclusion of the theorem is not an implication,
or if `x` is free in any of the assumptions.

### Example

    
       - val thm0 = mk_thm ([], Term `P (x:'a) ==> Q x`);
       > val thm0 =  |- P (x :'a) ==> Q x : thm
    
       - val thm1 = GEN_IMP (Term `x:'a`) thm0;
       > val thm1 =  |- (!x. P x) ==> (!x. Q x)
