\DOC ABS_CONV

\TYPE {ABS_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion to the body of an abstraction.

\KEYWORDS
conversional, abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion that maps a term {tm} to the theorem {|- tm = tm'},
then the conversion {ABS_CONV c} maps abstractions of the form {\x.tm} to
theorems of the form:
{
   |- (\x.tm) = (\x.tm')
}
\noindent That is, {ABS_CONV c "\x.t"} applies {c} to the body of the
abstraction {"\x.t"}.

\FAILURE
{ABS_CONV c tm} fails if {tm} is not an abstraction or if {tm} has the form
{"\x.t"} but the conversion {c} fails when applied to the term {t}. The
function returned by {ABS_CONV c} may also fail if the ML function
{c:term->thm} is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term
{M} to a theorem {|- M = N}).

\EXAMPLE
{
- let val M = Parse.Term `\x. 1 = x`
  in 
  ABS_CONV SYM_CONV M
  end;

|- (\x. 1 = x) = (\x. x = 1)
}
