## `FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY`

``` hol4
Drule.FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY : thm -> thm
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replace a theorem's type variables with fresh versions

A call to `FULL_GEN_TYVARIFTY th` replaces (with `INST_TYPE`) the type
variables occurring in theorem `th`. The new type variables are
generated by successive calls to `gen_tyvar`, so should not have been
seen before.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

The derived rule `GEN_TYVARIFY` will only instantiate those type
variables that are exclusively found in the conclusion. This is
reasonable when handling theorems derived from a tactic goal's
assumptions.
