PSELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)

KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon, equality.

LIBRARY
pair

SYNOPSIS
Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem
whose conclusion is equational:

    A |- t1 = t2


the inference rule {PSELECT_EQ} returns the theorem:

    A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)


provided no variable in {p} is free in the assumptions.

         A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  SELECT_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)




FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation,
of if {p} is not a paired structure of variables,
or if any variable in {p} is free in {A}.
