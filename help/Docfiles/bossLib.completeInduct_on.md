## `completeInduct_on` {#bossLib.completeInduct_on}


```
completeInduct_on : term quotation -> tactic
```



Perform complete induction.


If `q` parses into a well-typed term `M`, an invocation
`completeInduct_on q` begins a proof by complete (also known as
‘course-of-values’) induction on `M`. The term `M` should occur free in
the current goal.

### Failure

If `M` does not parse into a term or does not occur free in the
current goal.

### Example

Suppose we wish to prove that every number not equal to one has a prime
factor:
    
       !n. ~(n = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides n
    
A natural way to prove this is by complete induction. Invoking
`` completeInduct_on `n` `` yields the goal
    
          { !m. m < n ==> ~(m = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides m }
          ?-
          ~(n = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides n
