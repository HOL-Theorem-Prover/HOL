## `HEADGOAL` {#Tactical.HEADGOAL}


```
HEADGOAL : tactic -> list_tactic
```



The list-tactic which applies a tactic to the first member of a list of goals.


If `tac` is a tactic, `HEADGOAL tac` is a
list-tactic which applies the tactic `tac` to the
first member of a list of goals.

### Failure

The application of `HEADGOAL` to a tactic never fails.
The resulting list-tactic fails the goal list is empty or
or finally if `tac` fails when applied to the first member of the goal list.


Applying a tactic to the first subgoal.

### Example

Where `tac1` and `tac2` are tactics, `tac1 THEN_LT HEADGOAL tac2`
applies `tac1` to a goal, and then applies `tac2` to the first resulting
subgoal.
