## `EVAL_TAC` {#bossLib.EVAL_TAC}


```
EVAL_TAC : tactic
```



Evaluate a goal deductively.


Applying `EVAL_TAC` to a goal `A ?- g` results in `EVAL` being applied
to `g` to obtain `|- g = g'`. This theorem is used to transform the goal
to `A ?- g'`.

The notion of evaluation is based around rules for replacing constants
by their (equational) definitions. Thus `EVAL_TAC` is currently
suited to evaluation of expressions that look like functional programs.
Evaluation of inductive relations is not currently supported.

### Failure

Shouldnâ€™t fail, but may diverge.

### Example

`EVAL_TAC` reduces the goal `?-  P (REVERSE (FLAT [[x; y]; [a; b; c; d]]))`
to the goal
    
       ?- P [d; c; b; a; y; x]
    

### Comments

The main problem with `EVAL_TAC` is knowing when it will terminate. One
typical cause of non-termination is that a constant in the goal has not
been added to `the_compset`. Another is that a test in a conditional in
the expression may involve a variable.


Symbolic evaluation.
