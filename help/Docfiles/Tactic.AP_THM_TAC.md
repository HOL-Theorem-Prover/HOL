## `AP_THM_TAC` {#Tactic.AP_THM_TAC}


```
AP_THM_TAC : tactic
```



Strips identical operands from functions on both sides of an equation.


When applied to a goal of the form `A ?- f x = g x`, the tactic `AP_THM_TAC`
strips away the operands of the function application:
    
        A ?- f x = g x
       ================  AP_THM_TAC
          A ?- f = g
    



### Failure

Fails unless the goal has the above form, namely an equation both sides of
which consist of function applications to the same arguments.
