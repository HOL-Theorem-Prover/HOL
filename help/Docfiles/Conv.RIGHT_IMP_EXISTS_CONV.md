## `RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV` {#Conv.RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV}


```
RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV : conv
```



Moves an existential quantification of the consequent outwards through an
implication.


When applied to a term of the form `P ==> (?x.Q)`, the conversion
`RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV` returns the theorem:
    
       |- P ==> (?x.Q) = (?x'. P ==> (Q[x'/x]))
    
where `x'` is a primed variant of `x` that does not appear free in
the input term.

### Failure

Fails if applied to a term not of the form `P ==> (?x.Q)`.
