## `CHOOSE_THEN` {#Thm_cont.CHOOSE_THEN}


```
CHOOSE_THEN : thm_tactical
```



Applies a tactic generated from the body of existentially quantified theorem.


When applied to a theorem-tactic `ttac`, an existentially quantified
theorem `A' |- ?x. t`, and a goal, `CHOOSE_THEN` applies the tactic
`ttac (t[x'/x] |- t[x'/x])` to the goal, where `x'` is a variant of
`x` chosen not to be free in the assumption list of the goal. Thus if:
    
        A ?- s1
       =========  ttac (t[x'/x] |- t[x'/x])
        B ?- s2
    
then
    
        A ?- s1
       ==========  CHOOSE_THEN ttac (A' |- ?x. t)
        B ?- s2
    
This is invalid unless `A'` is a subset of `A`.

### Failure

Fails unless the given theorem is existentially quantified, or if the
resulting tactic fails when applied to the goal.

### Example

This theorem-tactical and its relatives are very useful for using existentially
quantified theorems. For example one might use the inbuilt theorem
    
       LESS_ADD_1 = |- !m n. n < m ==> (?p. m = n + (p + 1))
    
to help solve the goal
    
       ?- x < y ==> 0 < y * y
    
by starting with the following tactic
    
       DISCH_THEN (CHOOSE_THEN SUBST1_TAC o MATCH_MP LESS_ADD_1)
    
which reduces the goal to
    
       ?- 0 < ((x + (p + 1)) * (x + (p + 1)))
    
which can then be finished off quite easily, by, for example:
    
       REWRITE_TAC[ADD_ASSOC, SYM (SPEC_ALL ADD1),
                   MULT_CLAUSES, ADD_CLAUSES, LESS_0]
