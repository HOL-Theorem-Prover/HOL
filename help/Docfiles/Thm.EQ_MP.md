## `EQ_MP` {#Thm.EQ_MP}


```
EQ_MP : thm -> thm -> thm
```



Equality version of the Modus Ponens rule.


When applied to theorems `A1 |- t1 = t2` and `A2 |- t1`, the inference
rule `EQ_MP` returns the theorem `A1 u A2 |- t2`.
    
        A1 |- t1 = t2   A2 |- t1
       --------------------------  EQ_MP
             A1 u A2 |- t2
    



### Failure

Fails unless the first theorem is equational and its left side
is the same as the conclusion of the second theorem (and is therefore
of type `bool`), up to alpha-conversion.
