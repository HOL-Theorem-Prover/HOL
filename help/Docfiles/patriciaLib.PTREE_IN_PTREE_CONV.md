Conversion for evaluating applications of `patricia$IN_PTREE`.


The conversion `PTREE_IN_PTREE_CONV` evaluates terms of the form `n IN_PTREE t` where `t` is a well-formed unit Patricia tree (constructed by `patricia$Empty`, `patricia$Leaf` and `patricia$Branch`) and `n` is a natural number literal.

    > val it = |- 1 IN_PTREE <{}> <=> F: thm
    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_IN_PTREE_CONV ``3 IN_PTREE (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 ()) (Leaf 2 ()))``;
    > val it = |- 3 IN_PTREE Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 ()) (Leaf 2 ()) <=> T: thm
