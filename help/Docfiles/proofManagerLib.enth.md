## `enth` {#proofManagerLib.enth}


```
enth : tactic -> int -> proof
```



Applies a tactic to one goal, referenced by number, in the current goal list,
replacing that goal with the resulting subgoals.


`enth tac i` applies `tac` to all the iâ€™th goal in the current goal list,
replacing that goal in the goal list with the subgoals produced by `tac`.
It is an abbreviation for `expand_list (NTH_GOAL tac i)`.


For interactively constructing suitable compound tactics,
for example to test whether a particular subgoal can be proved easily,
before attacking the other subgoals.
