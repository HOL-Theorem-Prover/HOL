\TYPE {fv_term : (term -> tactic) -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a term-tactic to a goal's ``first'' free variable

\KEYWORDS
tactic, term-tactic

\DESCRIBE
Applying {fv_term tmtac} to a goal {A ?- g}, finds the first free
variable in the goal, and passes that variable to the function
{tmtac}, generating a tactic, which is then applied to the goal. The
first free variable is the first returned by successive calls to
{free_vars} applied to first {g} and then each assumption in {A} in
turn.

\FAILURE
Fails if a goal does not have any free variables, or if {tmtac v}
fails when applied to the goal, with {v} the ``first'' free variable
as defined above.

\EXAMPLE
{
            ?- 0 < f (n:num)
   ================================== fv_term (C tmCases_on ["", "j"])
     ?- 0 < f 0    ?- 0 < f (SUC j)
}
