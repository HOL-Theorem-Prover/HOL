## `failwith` {#Feedback.failwith}


```
failwith : string -> 'a
```



Raise a `HOL_ERR`.


The function `failwith` raises a `HOL_ERR` with default values. This is
useful when detailed error tracking is not necessary.

`failwith` differs from `fail` in that it takes an extra string argument,
which is typically used to tell which function `failwith` is being called
from.

### Failure

Always fails.

### Example

    
    - failwith "foo" handle e => Raise e;
    
    Exception raised at ??.failwith:
    foo
    ! Uncaught exception:
    ! HOL_ERR
