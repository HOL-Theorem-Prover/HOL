## `end_time` {#Lib.end_time}


```
end_time : Timer.cpu_timer -> unit
```



Check a running timer, and print out how long it has been running.


An application `end_time timer`	looks to see how long `timer` has been
running, and prints out the elapsed runtime, garbage collection time,
and system time.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - val clock = start_time();
    > val clock = <cpu_timer> : cpu_timer
    
    - use "foo.sml";
    > ... output omitted ...
    
    - end_time clock;
    runtime: 525.996s,    gctime: 0.000s,     systime: 525.996s.
    > val it = () : unit
    



### Comments

A `start_time` ... `end_time` pair is for use when calling `time`
would be clumsy, e.g., when multiple function applications are to
be timed.
