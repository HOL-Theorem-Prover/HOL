\TYPE {EXT_DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV : conseq_conv_congruence list -> int option -> bool -> directed_conseq_conv list -> directed_conseq_conv}


\SYNOPSIS
The general depth consequence conversion of which
{DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV}, {REDEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV}, {ONCE_DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV} etc
are just instantiations.

\DESCRIBE
{DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV} and similar conversions are able apply a
consequence conversion by breaking down the structure of a term using
lemmata about {/\}, {\/}, {~}, {==>} and quantification.  Thereby,
these conversions collect various amounts of context information.

{EXT_DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV} {congruence_list} {cache_opt} {step_opt}
{redepth} {convL} is the conversion used by these other depth
conversions. Its interface allows one to add to the given list of
boolean combinations and thus allow the conversion of parts of
user-defined predicates. This is done using {congruence_list}.
However, let's consider the other parameters first: {cache_opt}
determines which cache to use: {NONE} means no caching; a standard
cache that stores everything is configured by
{CONSEQ_CONV_default_cache_opt}.

The number of steps taken is determined by {step_opt}. {NONE} means
arbitrarily many; {SOME n} means at most n. {ONCE_DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV}
for example uses {SOME 1}. The parameter {redepth} determines whether
modified terms should be revisited and {convL} is a basically a list
of directed consequence conversions of the conversions that should be
applied at subpositions. Its entries consist of a flag, whether to
apply the conversion before or after descending into subterms; the
weight (i.e. the number of counted steps) for the conversion, and a
function from the context (a list of theorems) to the conversion.

The first parameter {congruence_list} is a list of congruences that
determine how to break down terms. Each element of this list has to be
a function {congruence context sys dir t} which returns a pair of the
number of performed steps and a resulting theorem. {sys} is a callback
that allows to apply the depth conversion recursively to
subterms. {context} gives the context that can be used, but is
normally just interesting for the conversions. If you ignore the
number of steps, the congruence is otherwise a directed consequence
conversion. If the congruence can't be applied, it should either fail
or raise an {UNCHANGED} exception. The callback {sys} gets the number
of already performed steps, a direction and a term. It then returns a
accumulated number of steps and a thm option. It never fails. The
number of steps is used to abort if the maximum number of globally
allowed steps has been reached. The first call of {sys} should get
{0}, then the accumulated number has to be passed. The congruence
should return the finally, accumulated number of steps. As an example,
a congruence for implications is implemented by
{
fun CONSEQ_CONV_CONGRUENCE___imp_simple_context context sys dir t =
  let
     val (b1,b2) = dest_imp t;

     (* simplify the precondition *)
     val (n1, thm1_opt) = sys [] 0 (CONSEQ_CONV_DIRECTION_NEGATE dir) b1;

     (* what did it simplify to? *)
     val a2 = CONSEQ_CONV___OPT_GET_SIMPLIFIED_TERM
                thm1_opt
                (CONSEQ_CONV_DIRECTION_NEGATE dir)
                b1;

     (* if precond is false, one does not need to process the conclusion *)
     val abort_cond = same_const a2 F;

     (* otherwise process the conclusion and add the precond as
        additional context *)
     val (n2, thm2_opt) = if abort_cond then (n1, NONE)
                          else sys [a2] n1 dir b2;

     (* abort, if nothing was done *)
     val _ = if (isSome thm1_opt) orelse (isSome thm2_opt) orelse
                abort_cond
             then ()
             else raise UNCHANGED;

     (* get theorems, if necessary create them and get the additional
        context as an additional implication *)
     val thm1 = conseq_conv_congruence_EXPAND_THM_OPT (thm1_opt, b1, NONE);
     val thm2 = conseq_conv_congruence_EXPAND_THM_OPT (thm2_opt, b2, SOME a2);

     (* apply congruence rule for these theorems *)
     val cong_thm =
         if (dir = CONSEQ_CONV_STRENGTHEN_direction) then
           IMP_CONG_simple_imp_strengthen
         else IMP_CONG_simple_imp_weaken
     val thm3 = MATCH_MP cong_thm (CONJ thm1 thm2)

     (* simplify output: (F ==> X) = X etc.
     val thm4 = CONV_RULE (dir_conv dir trivial_imp_simp) thm3
                 handle HOL_ERR _ => thm3
  in
     (n2, thm4)
  end handle HOL_ERR _ => raise CONSEQ_CONV_congruence_expection;
}
