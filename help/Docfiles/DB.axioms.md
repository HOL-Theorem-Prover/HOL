## `axioms` {#DB.axioms}


```
axioms : string -> (string * thm) list
```



All the axioms stored in the named theory.


An invocation `axioms thy`, where `thy` is the name of a currently
loaded theory segment, will return a list of the axioms stored in
that theory. Each theorem is paired with its name in the result.
The string `"-"` may be used to denote the current theory segment.

### Failure

Never fails. If `thy` is not the name of a currently loaded theory segment,
the empty list is returned.

### Example

    
    - axioms "bool";
    > val it =
        [("INFINITY_AX", |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f),
         ("SELECT_AX", |- !P x. P x ==> P ($@ P)),
         ("ETA_AX", |- !t. (\x. t x) = t),
         ("BOOL_CASES_AX", |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F))] : (string * thm) list
