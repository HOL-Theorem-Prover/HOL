\TYPE {Psyntax : Psyntax_sig}

\SYNOPSIS
A structure that provides a tuple-style environment for term manipulation.

\DESCRIBE
A lot of the familiar term construction and decomposition functions from
hol88 have different types in hol90. For those longing for the good old
days, Psyntax provides hol88-style types. The functions provided by
Psyntax return exactly the same results as their hol90 counterparts.

Each function in the Psyntax structure has a corresponding function in
the Rsyntax structure, and vice versa. One can flip-flop between the
two structures by opening one and then the other. One can also use
long identifiers in order to use both syntaxes at once.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how to open the Psyntax structure and the
functions that subsequently become available in the top level
environment. Documentation for each of these functions is available
online.
