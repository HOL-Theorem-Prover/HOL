## `start_time` {#Lib.start_time}


```
start_time : unit -> Timer.cpu_timer
```



Set a timer running.


An application `start_time ()` creates a timer and starts it. A later
invocation `end_time t`, where `t` is a timer, will need to be called
to get the elapsed time between the two function calls.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - val clock = start_time ();
    > val clock = <cpu_timer> : cpu_timer
    



### Comments

Multiple timers may be started without any interfering with the others.

Further operations associated with the type `cpu_timer` may be found
in the Standard ML Basis Library structures `Timer` and `Time`.
