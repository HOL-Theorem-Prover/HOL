## `dest_ptree` {#patriciaLib.dest_ptree}


```
dest_ptree : term -> term_ptree
```



Term destructor for Patricia trees.


The destructor `dest_ptree` will return a Patricia tree in ML that corresponds with the supplied HOL term.  The ML abstract data type `term_ptree` is defined in `patriciaLib`.

### Failure

The conversion will fail if the supplied term is not well constructed Patricia tree.

### Example

    
    - dest_ptree ``(Branch 1 2 (Leaf 2 2) (Leaf 3 3))``;
    Exception-
       HOL_ERR
      {message = "not a valid Patricia tree", origin_function = "dest_ptree",
      origin_structure = "patricia"} raised
    
    - dest_ptree ``(Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 3) (Leaf 2 2))``;
    val it = <ptree>: term_ptree
    

### Comments

By default PolyML prints abstract data types in full.  This can be turned off with:
    
    let
      fun pp _ _ (_: term_ptree) = PolyML.PrettyString "<ptree>"
    in
      PolyML.addPrettyPrinter pp
    end;
