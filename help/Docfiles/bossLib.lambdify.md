## `lambdify` {#bossLib.lambdify}


```
lambdify : thm -> thm
```



Convert a theorem representing a single-line definition into a fully
lambda-abstracted version.


Given a theorem which describes an equation for a constant applied to a series
of distinct variables, derive a reformulation which equates the constant with a
lambda-abstraction over those variables.


To advance a proof by unfolding a partially-applied function. Most effectively
used on theorems produced by `oneline`.

### Example

Consider the result of applying `oneline` to `listTheory.MAP`:
    
      > oneline listTheory.MAP;
      val it = ⊢ MAP f v = case v of [] => [] | h::t => f h::MAP f t: thm
    
      > lambdify it;
      val it = ⊢ MAP = (λf v. case v of [] => [] | h::t => f h::MAP f t): thm
    

### Failure

Fails on theorems of the wrong form, i.e. theorems which are not a single
equation with a left-hand side consisting of an application to a series of
distinct variables.

### Comments

Shorthand for `DefnBase.LIST_HALF_MK_ABS`.
