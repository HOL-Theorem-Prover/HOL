## `remove_ovl_mapping` {#Parse.remove_ovl_mapping}


```
remove_ovl_mapping: string -> {Name:string,Thy:string} -> unit
```



Removes an overloading mapping between the string and constant specified.


Each grammar maintains two maps internally.  One is from strings to
non-empty lists of terms, and the other is from terms to strings.  The
first map is used to resolve overloading when parsing.  A string will
eventually be turned into one of the terms in the list that it maps
to.  When printing a constant, the map in the opposite direction is
used to turn a term into a string.

A call to `remove_ovl_mapping s {Name,Thy}`, maps the `Name`-`Thy`
record to a constant `c`, and removes the `c`-`s` pair from both maps.

### Failure

Never fails.  If the given pair is not in either map, the function
silently does nothing.


To prune the overloading maps of unwanted possibilities.

### Comments

Note that removing a print-mapping for a constant will result in that
constant always printing fully qualified as `thy$name`.  This
situation will persist until that constant is given a name to map to
(either with `overload_on` or `update_overload_maps`).

As with other parsing functions, there is a sister function,
`temp_remove_ovl_mapping` that does the same thing, but whose effect
is not saved to a theory file.
