Signals to simplification tactics that an abbreviation should be used.


The `Abbr` function is used to signal to various simplification
tactics that an abbreviation in the current goal should be eliminated
before simplification proceeds.  Each theorem created by `Abbr` is
removed from the tactic’s theorem-list argument, and causes a call to
`Q.UNABBREV_TAC` with that `Abbr` theorem’s argument.  Finally, the
simplification tactic continues, with the rest of the theorem-list as
its argument.  Thus,
    
       tac [..., Abbr`v`, ..., Abbr`u`, ...]
    
has the same effect as
    
       Q.UNABBREV_TAC `v` THEN Q.UNABBREV_TAC `u` THEN
       tac [..., ..., ...]
    
Every theorem created by `Abbr` in the argument list is treated in
this way.  The tactics that understand `Abbr` arguments are
`SIMP_TAC`, `ASM_SIMP_TAC`, `FULL_SIMP_TAC`, `RW_TAC` and `SRW_TAC`.

### Failure

`Abbr` itself never fails, but the tactic it is used in may do,
particularly if the induced calls to `UNABBREV_TAC` fail.

### Comments

This function is a notational convenience that allows the effect of
multiple tactics to be packaged into just one.
