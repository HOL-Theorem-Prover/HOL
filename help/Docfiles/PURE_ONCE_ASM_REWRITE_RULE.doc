\DOC PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once, including the theorem's assumptions as rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} excludes the basic tautologies in
{basic_rewrites} from the theorems used for rewriting. It searches for
matching subterms once only, without recursing over already rewritten
subterms. For a general introduction to rewriting tools see
{GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
{PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not fail and does not diverge.
