## `ACCEPT_TAC` {#Tactic.ACCEPT_TAC}


```
ACCEPT_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Solves a goal if supplied with the desired theorem (up to alpha-conversion).


`ACCEPT_TAC` maps a given theorem `th` to a tactic that solves any goal whose
conclusion is alpha-convertible to the conclusion of `th`.

### Failure

`ACCEPT_TAC th (A,g)` fails if the term `g` is not alpha-convertible to the
conclusion of the supplied theorem `th`.

### Example

`ACCEPT_TAC` applied to the axiom
    
       BOOL_CASES_AX = |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)
    
will solve the goal
    
       ?- !x. (x = T) \/ (x = F)
    
but will fail on the goal
    
       ?- !x. (x = F) \/ (x = T)
    




Used for completing proofs by supplying an existing theorem, such as an axiom,
or a lemma already proved.
