## `ABS_TAC` {#Tactic.ABS_TAC}


```
ABS_TAC : tactic
```



Strips lambda abstraction on both sides of an equation.


When applied to a goal of the form `A ?- (\x. M) = (\y. N)` (where `M`
and `N` may or may not mention their respective bound variables), the
tactic `ABS_TAC` strips away the lambda abstractions:
    
        A ?- (\x. f x) = (\y. g y)
       ============================  ABS_TAC
                A ?- f x = g x
    



### Failure

Fails unless the goal has the above form, namely an equation both sides of
which consist of a lamdba abstraction.

### Comments

When the lambda abstractionsâ€™ bound variables conflict with existing
free variables in the goal, variants of those names may occur in the
goal that results.
