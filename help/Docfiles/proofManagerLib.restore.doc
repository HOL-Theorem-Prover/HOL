\TYPE {restore : unit -> proof}

\SYNOPSIS
Restores the proof state of the last save point, undoing the effects of expansions after the save point.

\DESCRIBE
The function {restore} is part of the subgoal package. A call to {restore}
restores the proof state to the last save point (a proof state saved by
{save}). If the current state is a save point then {restore} clears the
current save point and returns to the last save point. If there are no save
points in the history, then {restore} returns to the initial goal and is
equivalent to {restart}. For a description of the subgoal package, see
{set_goal}.

\FAILURE
The function {restore} will fail only if no goalstack is being managed.

\USES
Back tracking in a goal-directed proof to a user-defined save point.
