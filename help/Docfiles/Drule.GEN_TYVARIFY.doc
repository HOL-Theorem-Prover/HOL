\TYPE {GEN_TYVARIFY : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Replace a theorem's type variables with fresh versions

\DESCRIBE
A call to {GEN_TYVARIFY th} replaces (with {INST_TYPE}) the type
variables occurring in theorem {th}'s conclusion that do not also
appear in any of {th}'s hypotheses. The new type variables are
generated by successive calls to {gen_tyvar}, so should not have been
seen before.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The derived rule {FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY} will instantiate all of a
theorem's type variables, whether or not they appear in the
hypotheses.
