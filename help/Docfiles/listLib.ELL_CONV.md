## `ELL_CONV` {#listLib.ELL_CONV}


```
ELL_CONV : conv
```



Computes by inference the result of indexing an element of a list from the
tail end.


For any object language list of the form `“[xn-1;...;xk;...x0]”` ,
the result of evaluating
    
       ELL_CONV “ELL k [xn-1;...;xk;...;x0]”
    
is the theorem
    
       |- ELL k [xn-1;...;xk;...;x0] = xk
    
where `k` must not be greater then the length of the list.
Note that `ELL` indexes the list elements from the tail end.

### Failure

`ELL_CONV tm` fails if `tm` is not of the form described above,
or `k` is not less than the length of the list.
