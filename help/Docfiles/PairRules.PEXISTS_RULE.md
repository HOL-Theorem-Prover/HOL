## `PEXISTS_RULE` {#PairRules.PEXISTS_RULE}


```
PEXISTS_RULE : (thm -> thm)
```



Introduces a paired existential quantification in place of a paired choice.


The inference rule `PEXISTS_RULE` expects a theorem asserting that
`(@p. t)` denotes a pair for which `t` holds.
The equivalent assertion that there exists a `p` for which `t` holds is
returned.
    
        A |- t[(@p. t)/p]
       ------------------  PEXISTS_RULE
           A |- ?p. t
    



### Failure

Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
of the form `(t[(@p.t)/p])`.
