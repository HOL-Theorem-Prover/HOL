## `mk_thy_type` {#Type.mk_thy_type}


```
mk_thy_type
       : {Thy:string, Tyop:string, Args:hol_type list} -> hol_type
```



Constructs a type.


If `s` is a string that has been previously declared to be a type
with arity type `n` in theory `thy`, and the length of `tyl` is equal
to `n`, then `mk_thy_type{Tyop=s, Thy=thy, Args=tyl}` returns the
requested compound type.

### Failure

Fails if `s` is not the name of a type in theory `thy`, if `thy` is
not in the ancestry of the current theory, or if `n` is not
the length of `tyl`.

### Example

    
    - mk_thy_type {Tyop="fun", Thy="min", Args = [alpha,bool]};
    > val it = `:'a -> bool` : hol_type
    
    - try mk_thy_type {Tyop="bar", Thy="foo", Args = []};
    
    Exception raised at Type.mk_thy_type:
    "foo$bar" not found
    



### Comments

In general, `mk_thy_type` is to be preferred over `mk_type` because
HOL provides a fresh namespace for each theory (`mk_type` is a holdover
from a time when there was only one namespace shared by all theories).
