Applies congruence rules backwards repeatedly to attack an equality


Applying `CONG_TAC dopt` to a goal `?- x = y` attempts to apply
congruence rules backwards repeatedly, generating a number of further
equality subgoals. The `dopt` parameter limits the number of times
this will be done: when `dopt` is `NONE`, there is no limit: the base
transformation will be tried on the initial and all subsequent goals.
If `dopt` is `SOME i`, then `i` is the total number of transformations
that will be made. (If `dopt` is `SOME 0` then `CONG_TAC dopt` is
equivalent to `ALL_TAC`.)

If at least one of the equality’s arguments is an abstraction (possibly paired),
then the transformation rewrites with function extensionality, strips the
universally quantified variables, and beta-reduces where necessary.

If at least one of the equality’s arguments is a set comprehension,
then the transformation rewrites with set-extensionality and applies
the conversion that calculates what it is for a term to be a member of
a comprehension to one or both sides of the equality. Unless both
sides are set comprehensions, this is likely to be the last
transformation possible.

If the goal matches the conclusion of any of the theorems stored as
congruences for the definition package (with attribute name `defncong`
or `cong`), then this theorem is applied backwards to generate new
sub-goals. If the new sub-goals include preconditions and universally
quantified variables, these are stripped into the assumptions.

Finally, the “base transformation” depends on the shape of the equality’s
arguments. If both sides are combinations (`M e1` and `N e2`, say),
then the base transformation will be similar to an application of
`MK_COMB_TAC`, generating at least the goals `?- M = N` and `?- e1 = e2`.
When the head terms of both applications are equal, then one step
of the base transformation is taken to be the iteration of
`MK_COMB_TAC` that strips all arguments, so that `?- f e1 .. en = f e1' .. en'`
will turn into `n` subgoals, each of the form `?- ei = ei'`. (The `?- f = f`
subgoal will be eliminated immediately, as below.)

In all cases, new subgoals that are instances of reflexivity, or which
occur in the goal’s assumptions (with either orientation) are
immediately eliminated.

### Failure

Fails if the provided depth is either `NONE` or `SOME i` with `i`
greater than zero, and the goal is not an equality at all, or cannot
be changed by any of the transformations described above. For example,
with `f : 'a -> num` and `g : num -> num`, the goal `?- f a = g n`
cannot be reduced.

### Example

The following involves a handling of abstractions:
    
       > CONG_TAC NONE ([], “(∀x. f (z:'a) < x) ⇔ (∀y. c < y)”);
       val it = ([([], “f z = c”)], fn): goal list * validation
    
Slightly altering the goal, and keeping the depth as `NONE` turns
something true into something unprovable:
    
       > CONG_TAC NONE ([], “(∀x. f (z:'a) < x) ⇔ (∀y. y < 6)”);
       val it = ([([], “f z = x”), ([], “x = 6”)], fn): goal list * validation
    
where the `x` in each sub-goal is completely fresh.

Finally, user-congruences can give richer contexts when proving functions 
equal: 
    
       > CONG_TAC NONE 
           ([], “MAP (λa. f a + 1) (l1:'a list) = MAP g (l2:'a list)”);
       val it = ([([“MEM x l2”], “f x + 1 = g x”), ([], “l1 = l2”)], fn):
          goal list * validation
    

### Comments

This is a powerful tool for taking apart two terms that share a
skeleton and need only have their leaves shown to be equal. Equally,
it is quite possible for this tactic to turn a solvable goal into an
unsolvable one.

An application of `CONG_TAC` will never break apart the function
applications that lie within the representation of natural number
numerals.

The name `cong_tac` can be used as an alias for `CONG_TAC`.
