\DOC FOLDL_CONV

\TYPE {FOLDL_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of applying a function to the elements of a
list.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, list.

\DESCRIBE
{FOLDL_CONV} takes a conversion {conv} and a term {tm} in the following form:
{
   FOLDL f e [x0;...xn]
}
It returns the theorem
{
   |- FOLDL f e [x0;...xn] = tm'
}
where {tm'} is the result of applying the function {f} iteratively to
the successive elements of the list and the result of the previous
application starting from the tail end of the list. During each
iteration, an expression {f ei xi} is evaluated. The user supplied
conversion {conv} is used to derive a theorem 
{
   |- f ei xi = e(i+1)
}
which is used in the next iteration.

\FAILURE
{FOLDL_CONV conv tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above.

\EXAMPLE
To sum the elements of a list,  one can use
{FOLDL_CONV} with {ADD_CONV} from the library {num_lib}.
{
   - load_library_in_place num_lib;
   - FOLDL_CONV Num_lib.ADD_CONV (--`FOLDL $+ 0 [0;1;2;3]`--);
   |- FOLDL $+ 0[0;1;2;3] = 6
}
In general, if the function {f} is an explicit lambda abstraction
{(\x x'. t[x,x'])}, the conversion should be in the form
{
   ((RATOR_CONV BETA_CONV) THENC BETA_CONV THENC conv'))
}
where {conv'} applied to {t[x,x']} returns the theorem
{
   |-t[x,x'] = e''.
}
