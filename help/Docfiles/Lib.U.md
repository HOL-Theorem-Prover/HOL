## `U` {#Lib.U}


```
U : ''a list list -> ''a list
```



Takes the union of a list of sets.


An application `U [l1, ..., ln]` is equivalent to
`union l1 (... (union ln-1, ln)...)`. Thus, every element that
occurs in one of the lists will appear in the result.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - U [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [1,2,5]];
    > val it = [3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5] : int list
    



### Comments

The order in which the elements occur in the resulting list should
not be depended upon.

A high-performance implementation of finite sets may be found in
structure `HOLset`.

ML equality types are used in the implementation of `U` and its kin.
This limits its applicability to types that allow equality. For other
types, typically abstract ones, use the ‘op_’ variants.
