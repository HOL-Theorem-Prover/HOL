\TYPE {export_theory : unit -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Write a theory segment to disk.

\KEYWORDS
theory, export, file.

\DESCRIBE
If the {Globals.interactive} flag is false, an invocation
{export_theory()} saves the current theory segment to disk. All
parents, definitions, axioms, and stored theorems of the segment are
saved in such a way that, when the theory is loaded from disk in a
later session, the full theory in place at the time {export_theory}
was called is re-instated.

If the {Globals.interactive} flag is true, the call {export_theory()}
does nothing, returning unit {()} instantly.

If the current theory segment is named {thy}, then {export_theory()}
will create ML files {thyTheory.sig} and {thyTheory.sml}, in
the current directory at the time {export_theory} is invoked. These
files need to be compiled before they become usable. In the standard way
of doing things, the {Holmake} facility will handle this task.

Once a theory segment has been exported and compiled, it is available
for use. It can be brought into an interactive proof session via
{
   load "thyTheory";
}
When the segment is loaded, its parents, axioms, theorems, and
definitions are incorporated into the current theory (recall that this
notion is different than the current theory segment).

\FAILURE
A call to {export_theory} may fail if the disk file cannot be opened.
A call to {export_theory} will also fail if some bindings are such that
the name of the binding is not a valid ML identifier. In that case,
{export_theory} will report all such bad names. These can be changed with
{set_MLname}, and then {export_theory} may be attempted again.

\EXAMPLE
{
> save_thm("foo", REFL “x:bool”);
val it = |- x = x : thm

> Globals.interactive := false;
val it = () : unit

> export_theory();
Exporting theory "scratch" ... done.
val it = () : unit
}

\COMMENTS
Note that {export_theory} exports the state of the theory (which can
include other user-definable data in addition to the logical content
(theorems, definitions, etc.), but not the state of the SML session.

When theories are developed interactively, the {interactive} flag will
typically be set to {true}; preventing {export_theory()} from doing
anything in this situation reserves special behaviours for when
theories are built with {Holmake}.
