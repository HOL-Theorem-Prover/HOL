\TYPE {g : term quotation -> proofs}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the subgoal package with a new goal which has no assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   g `tm`
}
is equivalent to
{
   set_goal([],Term`tm`)
}
and clearly more convenient if a goal has no assumptions.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the argument term has type {bool}.

\EXAMPLE
{
- g `(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])`;
> val it =
    Proof manager status: 1 proof.
    1. Incomplete:
         Initial goal:
         (HD [1; 2; 3] = 1) /\ (TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3])



    : GoalstackPure.proofs
}
