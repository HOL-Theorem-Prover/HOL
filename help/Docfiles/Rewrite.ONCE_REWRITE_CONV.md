## `ONCE_REWRITE_CONV` {#Rewrite.ONCE_REWRITE_CONV}


```
ONCE_REWRITE_CONV : (thm list -> conv)
```



Rewrites a term, including built-in tautologies in the list of rewrites.


`ONCE_REWRITE_CONV` searches for matching subterms and applies
rewrites once at each subterm, in the manner specified for
`ONCE_DEPTH_CONV`. The rewrites which are used are obtained from the
given list of theorems and the set of tautologies stored in
`implicit_rewrites`. See `GEN_REWRITE_CONV` for the general method of
using theorems to rewrite a term.

### Failure

`ONCE_REWRITE_CONV` does not fail; it does not diverge.


`ONCE_REWRITE_CONV` can be used to rewrite a term when recursive
rewriting is not desired.
