## `PRUNE_SOME_CONV` {#unwindLib.PRUNE_SOME_CONV}


```
PRUNE_SOME_CONV : (string list -> conv)
```



Prunes several hidden variables.


`` PRUNE_SOME_CONV [`li1`;...;`lik`] `` when applied to the term:
    
       "?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqni1 /\ ... /\ eqnik /\ ... /\ tp"
    
returns a theorem of the form:
    
       |- (?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqni1 /\ ... /\ eqnik /\ ... /\ tp) =
          (?li(k+1) ... lir. t1 /\ ... /\ tp)
    
where for `1 <= j <= k`, each `eqnij` has the form:
    
       "!y1 ... ym. lij x1 ... xn = b"
    
and `lij` does not appear free in any of the other conjuncts or in
`b`. The `li`’s are related by the equation:
    
       {{li1,...,lik}} u {{li(k+1),...,lir}} = {{l1,...,lr}}
    
The conversion works if one or more of the `eqnij`’s are not present,
that is if `lij` is not free in any of the conjuncts, but does not work if
`lij` appears free in more than one of the conjuncts. `p` may be zero, that is,
all the conjuncts may be `eqnij`’s. In this case the body of the result will be
`T` (true). Also, for each `eqnij`, `m` and `n` may be zero.

If there is more than one line with a specified name (but with different
types), the one that appears outermost in the existential quantifications is
pruned. If such a line name is mentioned twice in the list, the two outermost
occurrences of lines with that name will be pruned, and so on.

### Failure

Fails if the argument term is not of the specified form or if any of the
`lij`’s are free in more than one of the conjuncts or if the equation for any
`lij` is recursive. The function also fails if any of the specified lines are
not one of the existentially quantified lines.

### Example

    
    #PRUNE_SOME_CONV [`l1`;`l2`]
    # "?l3 l2 l1.
    #   (!(x:num). l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~(l3 x)) /\ (!(x:num). l3 x = T)";;
    |- (?l3 l2 l1. (!x. l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~l3 x) /\ (!x. l3 x = T)) =
       (?l3. !x. l3 x = T)
