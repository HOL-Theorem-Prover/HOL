RULE_ASSUM_TAC : ((thm -> thm) -> tactic)

SYNOPSIS
Maps an inference rule over the assumptions of a goal.

KEYWORDS
tactic, assumption, rule.

DESCRIBE
When applied to an inference rule {f} and a goal {({A1,...,An} ?- t)},
the {RULE_ASSUM_TAC} tactical applies the inference rule to each of the
{ASSUME}d assumptions to give a new goal.

             {A1,...,An} ?- t
   ====================================  RULE_ASSUM_TAC f
    {f(A1 |- A1),...,f(An |- An)} ?- t




FAILURE
The application of {RULE_ASSUM_TAC f} to a goal fails iff {f} fails when
applied to any of the assumptions of the goal.

COMMENTS
It does not matter if the goal has no assumptions, but in this case
{RULE_ASSUM_TAC} has no effect.

SEEALSO
Tactic.RULE_L_ASSUM_TAC, Tactical.ASSUM_LIST, Tactical.MAP_EVERY,
Tactical.MAP_FIRST, Tactical.POP_ASSUM_LIST.
