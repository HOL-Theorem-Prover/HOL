## `EVALn` {#bossLib.EVALn}


```
EVALn : int -> conv
```



Evaluate a term by deduction, limiting number of steps taken.


An invocation `EVALn n M` symbolically evaluates `M` by applying the
defining equations of constants occurring in `M`, stopping when `M`
reduces to a normal form, or after `n` reduction steps have occurred.
If `n` is large enough and there is a normal form, the behaviour will
be the same as `EVAL M`, which see.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

In the example below, a custom pretty-printer hides a potentially
large term involving the terms that are used to represent
intermediates stages of numeral computation.
    
       - EVALn 50 “MAP (\x. x * x) [1;2;3;4;5]”;
       val it =
          ⊢ MAP (λx. x²) [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] =
            1::4:: <..num comp'n..> ::MAP (λx. x²) [4; 5]: thm
