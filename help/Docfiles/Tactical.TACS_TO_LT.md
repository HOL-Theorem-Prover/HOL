## `TACS_TO_LT` {#Tactical.TACS_TO_LT}


```
TACS_TO_LT : tactic list -> list_tactic
```



The list-tactic which applies a list of tactics to the
corresponding members of a list of goals.


If `T1,...,Tn` are tactics, `TACS_TO_LT [T1,...,Tn]` is a
list-tactic which applies the tactics `T1,...,Tn` to the
corresponding goals.

### Failure

The application of `TACS_TO_LT` to a tactic list never fails.
The resulting list-tactic fails if length of the goal list
is not the same as that of the tactic list,
or finally if `Ti` fails when applied to the `i`â€™th member of the goal list.


Applying different tactics to different subgoals.

### Example

Where `tac1` is a tactic and `tacs2` is a list of tactics,
`tac1 THEN_LT TACS_TO_LT tacs2` is equivalent to `tac1 THENL tacs2`
