## `cheat` {#bossLib.cheat}


```
cheat : tactic
```



Discharge a goal without proving it.


The `cheat` tactic solves the current goal immediately without proving it,
using `mk_oracle_thm` and adding the `"cheat"` tag to any theorem thereby
obtained.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

The intended use of `cheat` is to temporarily plug gaps in large theory
developments in order to sketch the bigger picture before filling in the
details. It can be useful as a kind of high-level `SUFF_TAC`: cheat on a
difficult lemma, see whether it works as intended for the main theorem, then go
back and prove the lemma properly.

The usual caveats associated with `mk_oracle_thm` apply: cheating exposes you
to the possibility of false theorems and contradictions. To be sure a theorem
was proved without cheating, check its tags.
