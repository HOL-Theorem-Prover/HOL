## `rename_bvar` {#Term.rename_bvar}


```
rename_bvar : string -> term -> term
```



Performs one step of alpha conversion.


If `M` is a lambda abstraction, i.e., has the form `\v.N`, an
invocation `rename_bvar s M` performs one step of alpha conversion to
obtain `\s. N[s/v]`.

### Failure

If `M` is not a lambda abstraction.

### Example

    
    - rename_bvar "x" (Term `\v. v ==> w`);
    > val it = `\x. x ==> w` : term
    
    - rename_bvar "x" (Term `\y. y /\ x`);
    > val it = `\x'. x' /\ x` : term
    



### Comments

`rename_bvar` takes constant time in the current implementation.
