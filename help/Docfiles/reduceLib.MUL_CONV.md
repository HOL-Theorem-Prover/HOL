## `MUL_CONV`

``` hol4
reduceLib.MUL_CONV : conv
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculates by inference the product of two numerals.

If `m` and `n` are numerals (e.g.Â `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`,...), then
`MUL_CONV "m * n"` returns the theorem:

``` hol4
   |- m * n = s
```

where `s` is the numeral that denotes the product of the natural numbers
denoted by `m` and `n`.

### Failure

`MUL_CONV tm` fails unless `tm` is of the form `"m * n"`, where `m` and
`n` are numerals.

### Example

``` hol4
#MUL_CONV "0 * 12";;
|- 0 * 12 = 0

#MUL_CONV "1 * 1";;
|- 1 * 1 = 1

#MUL_CONV "6 * 11";;
|- 6 * 11 = 66
```
