\TYPE {cj : int -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the i’th conjunct of a “guarded” theorem

\KEYWORDS
Derived rule

\DESCRIBE
A call to {cj i th}, where {th} has the form
{
   |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==>
                                          c1 /\ c2 /\ ... ck
}
returns the theorem
{
   |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==> ci
}
Note that the indexing starts at 1. The conjuncts are stripped apart
without regard to the way in which they are associated, as per the
behaviour of {CONJUNCTS}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the guarded theorem does not contain at
least {i} conjuncts. A bare term is always considered to be 1 conjunct.
