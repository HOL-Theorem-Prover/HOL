## `eta_conv` {#Term.eta_conv}


```
eta_conv : term -> term
```



Performs one step of eta-reduction.


Eta-reduction is an important operation in the lambda calculus.
A step of eta-reduction may be performed by `eta_conv M`, where `M`
is a lambda abstraction of the following form: `\v. (N v)`, i.e.,
a lambda abstraction whose body is an application of a term `N` to
the bound variable `v`. Moreover, `v` must not occur free in `M`.
If this proviso is met, an invocation `eta_conv (\v. (N v))` is equal
to `N`.

### Failure

If `M` is not of the specified form, or if `v` occurs free in `N`.

### Example

    
    - eta_conv (Term `\n. PRE n`);
    > val it = `PRE` : term
    



### Comments

Eta-reduction embodies the principle of extensionality, which is
basic to the HOL logic.
