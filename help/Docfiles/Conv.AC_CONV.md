## `AC_CONV` {#Conv.AC_CONV}


```
AC_CONV : (thm * thm) -> conv
```



Proves equality of terms using associative and commutative laws.


Suppose `_` is a function, which is assumed to be infix in the following
syntax, and `ath` and `cth` are theorems expressing its associativity and
commutativity; they must be of the following form, except that any free
variables may have arbitrary names and may be universally quantified:
    
       ath = |- m _ (n _ p) = (m _ n) _ p
       cth = |- m _ n = n _ m
    
Then the conversion `AC_CONV(ath,cth)` will prove equations whose
left and right sides can be made identical using these associative and
commutative laws.

### Failure

Fails if the associative or commutative law has an invalid form, or if the
term is not an equation between AC-equivalent terms.

### Example

Consider the terms `x + SUC t + ((3 + y) + z)` and `3 + SUC t + x + y + z`.
`AC_CONV` proves them equal.
    
       - AC_CONV(ADD_ASSOC,ADD_SYM)
           (Term `x + (SUC t) + ((3 + y) + z) = 3 + (SUC t) + x + y + z`);
    
       > val it =
         |- (x + ((SUC t) + ((3 + y) + z)) = 3 + ((SUC t) + (x + (y + z)))) = T
    



### Comments

Note that the preproved associative and commutative laws for the operators `+`,
`*`, `/\` and `\/` are already in the right form to give to `AC_CONV`.
