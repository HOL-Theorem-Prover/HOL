## `REDUCE_TAC` {#reduceLib.REDUCE_TAC}


```
REDUCE_TAC : tactic
```



Performs arithmetic or boolean reduction on a goal at all levels possible.


`REDUCE_TAC` attempts to transform a goal by applying `REDUCE_CONV`.
It will prove any true goal which is constructed from numerals and the boolean
constants `T` and `F`.

### Failure

Never fails, but may not advance the goal.

### Example

The following example takes a couple of minutes’ CPU time:

    
       > g ‘((1 EXP 3) + (12 EXP 3) = 1729) /\ ((9 EXP 3) + (10 EXP 3) = 1729)’;
    
       > e reduceLib.REDUCE_TAC;;
       OK..
       val it = 
          Initial goal proved
          ⊢ 1 EXP 3 + 12 EXP 3 = 1729 ∧ 9 EXP 3 + 10 EXP 3 = 1729 : proof
