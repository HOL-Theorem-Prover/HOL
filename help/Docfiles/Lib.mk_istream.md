## `mk_istream`

``` hol4
Lib.mk_istream : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('a,'b) istream
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a stream.

An application `mk_istream trans init proj` creates an imperative stream
of elements. The stream is generated by applying `trans` to the state.
The first element in the stream state is `init`. The value of the state
is obtained by applying `proj`.

### Failure

If an application of `trans` or `proj` fails when applied to the state.

### Example

The following creates a stream of distinct strings.

``` hol4
   - mk_istream (fn x => x+1) 0 (concat "gsym" o int_to_string);
   > val it = <istream> : (int, string) istream
```

### Comments

It is aesthetically unpleasant that the underlying implementation type
is visible.

See any book on ML programming to see how functional streams are built.
