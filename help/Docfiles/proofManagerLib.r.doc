\TYPE {r : int -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Reorders the subgoals on top of the subgoal package goal stack.

\DESCRIBE
The function {r} is part of the subgoal package.  The name {rotate}
may also be used to access the same function.  For a general
description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

The {r} function's basic step of operation is to take the first
element of the current list of sub-goals and move it to the end of the
same list.  The numeric argument passed to {r} specifies how many
times this operation is to be performed.

\FAILURE
Raises the {NO_PROOFS} exception if there is no current proof
manipulated by the subgoal package.  Raises a {HOL_ERR} if the current
goal state only has one sub-goal, or if the argument passed to {r} is
negative.

\USES
Interactively attacking subgoals in a different order to that
generated by the subgoal package.
