\TYPE {goal_assum : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes the goal available as a (negated) assumption for a theorem-tactic.

\KEYWORDS
Theorem-tactic

\DESCRIBE
An application of {goal_assum ttac} to the goal {(A,w0)} can be seen
as a tactic that first transforms the goal into {(w1::A,F)} (as if
starting a proof by contradiction, normalising {¬w0} into an
equivalent {w1}); pops the new assumption {w1} and applies the
theorem-tactic {ttac} to this theorem ({w1 ⊢ w1}); and when this
completes, renormalises the conclusion of the goal if it has turned
into something of the form {w2 ⇒ F}.

The first normalisation phase will turn something of the form {¬p}
into {p⇒F}, and will also flip outermost existential quantifiers into
universals. Thus, if the {w0} term was {∃x. P x ∧ Q (f x)}, the {w1}
term will be {∀x. P x ∧ Q (f x) ⇒ F}. The second normalisation phase
will undo this, so that if the effect of {ttac} is equivalent to a
call of {MP_TAC th'} with {th'} a universally quantified implication
into falsity, then the goal will again become an existentially
quantified conjunction.

\FAILURE
Fails if {ttac} fails when applied to the theorem {w1 ⊢ w1} and the
goal {(A,F)}.
