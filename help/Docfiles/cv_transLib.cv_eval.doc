\TYPE {cv_eval : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Uses {cv_computeLib} to evaluate closed terms, equipped with translations from
{cv_transLib}.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
Provides a user-friendly interface to {cv_computeLib.cv_compute}, as long as
{cv_transLib} has been used to translate all constants in the given input term.

\FAILURE
When the input term contains either free variables or constants which have not
yet been translated.

\EXAMPLE

{
> cv_trans arithmeticTheory.FACT;
Equations stored under "cv_FACT_def".
Induction stored under "cv_FACT_ind".
Finished translating FACT, stored in cv_FACT_thm
val it = (): unit
> cv_eval “FACT 50”;
val it =
   ⊢ FACT 50 =
