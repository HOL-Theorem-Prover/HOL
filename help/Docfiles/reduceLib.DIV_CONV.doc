\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{DIV_CONV "m DIV n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m DIV n = s
}
where {s} is the numeral that denotes the result of dividing the
natural number denoted by {m} by the natural number denoted by {n}, with
truncation.

\FAILURE
{DIV_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m DIV n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals, or if {n} denotes zero.

\EXAMPLE
{
#DIV_CONV "0 DIV 0";;
evaluation failed     DIV_CONV

#DIV_CONV "0 DIV 12";;
|- 0 DIV 12 = 0

#DIV_CONV "2 DIV 0";;
evaluation failed     DIV_CONV

#DIV_CONV "144 DIV 12";;
|- 144 DIV 12 = 12

#DIV_CONV "7 DIV 2";;
|- 7 DIV 2 = 3
}
