## `SUBST1_TAC` {#Tactic.SUBST1_TAC}


```
SUBST1_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Makes a simple term substitution in a goal using a single equational theorem.


Given a theorem `A'|-u=v` and a goal `(A,t)`, the tactic
`SUBST1_TAC (A'|-u=v)` rewrites the term `t` into `t[v/u]`, by substituting
`v` for each free occurrence of `u` in `t`:
    
          A ?- t
       =============  SUBST1_TAC (A'|-u=v)
        A ?- t[v/u]
    
The assumptions of the theorem used to substitute with are not added
to the assumptions of the goal but are recorded in the proof.  If `A'` is not a
subset of the assumptions `A` of the goal (up to alpha-conversion), then
`SUBST1_TAC (A'|-u=v)` results in an invalid tactic.

`SUBST1_TAC` automatically renames bound variables to prevent free variables in
`v` becoming bound after substitution.

### Failure

`SUBST1_TAC th (A,t)` fails if the conclusion of `th` is not an equation.
No change is made to the goal if no free occurrence of the left-hand side
of `th` appears in `t`.

### Example

When trying to solve the goal
    
       ?- m * n = (n * (m - 1)) + n
    
substituting with the commutative law for multiplication
    
       SUBST1_TAC (SPECL ["m:num"; "n:num"] MULT_SYM)
    
results in the goal
    
       ?- n * m = (n * (m - 1)) + n
    




`SUBST1_TAC` is used when rewriting with a single theorem using tactics such as
`REWRITE_TAC` is too expensive or would diverge. Applying `SUBST1_TAC` is also
much faster than using rewriting tactics.
