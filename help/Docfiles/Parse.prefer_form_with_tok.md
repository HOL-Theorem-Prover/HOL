## `prefer_form_with_tok` {#Parse.prefer_form_with_tok}


```
prefer_form_with_tok : {term_name : string, tok : string} -> unit
```



Sets a grammar ruleâ€™s preferred flag, causing it to be preferentially printed.


A call to `prefer_form_with_tok` causes the parsing/pretty-printing
rule specified by the `term_name`-`tok` combination to be the
preferred rule for pretty-printing purposes.  This change affects
the global grammar.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

Imagine that one wants to use an infix `"U"` to stand for the `"UNION"` term.
This could be done as follows:
    
       > set_mapped_fixity {term_name = "UNION", fixity = Infixl 500,
                            tok = "U"};
       val it = () : unit
    
       > ``s U t``;
       val it = ``s U t`` : term
    
       > dest_term it;
       val it = COMB(``$UNION s``, ``t``) : lambda
    
Having made this change, one might prefer to see the form with `UNION`
printed:
    
       > prefer_form_with_tok {term_name = "UNION", tok = "UNION"};
       val it = () : unit
    
       > ``s U t``;
       val it = ``s UNION t`` : term
    

### Comments

As the example above demonstrates, using this function does not affect the
parser at all.

There is a companion `temp_prefer_form_with_tok` function, which has
the same effect on the global grammar, but which does not cause this
effect to persist when the current theory is exported.
