## `tyvar_sequence` {#boolLib.tyvar_sequence}


```
tyvar_sequence : int -> hol_type list
```



Generates a canonical list of distinct type variables.


A call to `tyvar_sequence n` generates a list consisting of `n`
distinct type variables, with early members of the sequence being
`:'a` (“alpha”), `:'b` (“beta”) etc. After the first 26 members of
the list, the remainder are of the form `:'a1`, `:'a2` etc.

### Failure

Never fails.  If `n` is negative the generated list is empty.

### Example

    
    > tyvar_sequence 3;
    val it = [“:α”, “:β”, “:γ”] : hol_type list
