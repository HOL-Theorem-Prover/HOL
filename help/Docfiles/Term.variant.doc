\DOC variant

\TYPE {variant : term list -> term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Modifies a variable name to avoid clashes.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of variables to avoid clashing with, and a
variable to modify, {variant} returns a variant of the variable to
modify, that is, it changes the name as intuitively as possible to
make it distinct from any variables in the list, or any constants.
This is done by adding primes to the name.

The exact form of the variable name should not be relied on, except
that the original variable will be returned unmodified unless it is
itself in the list to avoid clashing with, or if it is the name of a
constant.

\FAILURE
{variant l t} fails if any term in the list {l} is not a variable or if
{t} is not a variable.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows a couple of typical cases:
{
   > variant [``y:bool``, ``z:bool``] ``x:bool``;
   val it = ``x`` : term

   > variant [``x:bool``, ``x':num``, ``x'':num``] ``x:bool``;
   > val it = ``x'''`` : term
}
while the following shows that clashes with the names of constants
are also avoided:
{
   > variant [] (mk_var("T",bool));
   val it = ``T'`` : term
}

\USES
The function {variant} is extremely useful for complicated derived
rules which need to rename variables to avoid free variable capture
while still making the role of the variable obvious to the user.

\COMMENTS
There is a `Term.numvariant` function that has the same type
signature, but which varies by adding and then incrementing a numeric
suffix to the variable’s stem.
