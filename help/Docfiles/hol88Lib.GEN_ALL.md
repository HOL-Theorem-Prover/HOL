## `GEN_ALL` {#hol88Lib.GEN_ALL}


```
GEN_ALL : thm -> thm
```



Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem over its own free variables.


When applied to a theorem `A |- t`, the inference rule `GEN_ALL` returns
the theorem `A |- !x1...xn. t`, where the `xi` are all the variables,
if any, which are free in `t` but not in the assumptions.
    
             A |- t
       ------------------  GEN_ALL
        A |- !x1...xn. t
    

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

Superseded by `Drule.GEN_ALL`, which, however, may return a different
result. That is why `GEN_ALL` is in `hol88Lib`. Sometimes people write
code that depends on the order of the quantification. They shouldnâ€™t.
