## `remove_user_printer` {#Parse.remove_user_printer}


```
remove_user_printer :
  string -> (term * term_grammar.userprinter) option
```



Removes a user-defined pretty-printing function associated with a
particular name.


This removes the user-defined pretty-printing function that has been
associated with a particular name (the name of the code for the
function).  If there is such a printer in the global grammar for the
specified type, this is returned in the option type.  If there is no
printer, then `NONE` is returned.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

As always, there is an accompanying function
`temp_remove_user_printer`, which does not affect the grammar exported
to disk.
