## `NULL_OK_LT` {#Tactical.NULL_OK_LT}


```
NULL_OK_LT : list_tactic -> list_tactic
```



Makes a list-tactic succeed with no effect when applied to the empty goal list.


For any list-tactic `ltac`, the application `NULL_OK_LT ltac`
gives a new list-tactic which has the same effect as `ltac` when applied to
a non-empty goal list.  Applied to the empty goal list it succeeds with no
effect.

### Failure

The application of `NULL_OK_LT` to a list-tactic `ltac` never fails.
The resulting list-tactic fails if applied to a non-empty goal list on which
`ltac` fails.
