\TYPE {SUB_AND_COND_ELIM_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates natural number subtraction, PRE, and conditional statements from a
formula.

\DESCRIBE
This function eliminates natural number subtraction and the predecessor
function, {PRE}, from a formula, but in doing so may generate conditional
statements, so these are eliminated too. The conditional statements are moved
up through the term and if at any point the branches of the conditional become
Boolean-valued the conditional is eliminated. Subtraction operators are moved
up until a relation (such as less-than) is reached. The subtraction can then
be transformed into an addition. Provided the argument term is a formula, only
an abstraction can prevent a conditional being moved up far enough to be
eliminated. If the term is not a formula it may not be possible to eliminate
the subtraction. The function is also incapable of eliminating subtractions
that appear in arguments to functions other than the standard operators of
arithmetic.

The function is not as delicate as it could be; it tries to eliminate all
conditionals in a formula when it need only eliminate those that have to be
removed in order to eliminate subtraction.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#SUB_AND_COND_ELIM_CONV
# "((p + 3) <= n) ==> (!m. ((m = 0) => (n - 1) | (n - 2)) > p)";;
|- (p + 3) <= n ==> (!m. ((m = 0) => n - 1 | n - 2) > p) =
   (p + 3) <= n ==>
   (!m. (~(m = 0) \/ n > (1 + p)) /\ ((m = 0) \/ n > (2 + p)))

#SUB_AND_COND_ELIM_CONV
# "!f n. f ((SUC n = 0) => 0 | (SUC n - 1)) < (f n) + 1";;
|- (!f n. (f((SUC n = 0) => 0 | (SUC n) - 1)) < ((f n) + 1)) =
   (!f n.
     (~(SUC n = 0) \/ (f 0) < ((f n) + 1)) /\
     ((SUC n = 0) \/ (f((SUC n) - 1)) < ((f n) + 1)))

#SUB_AND_COND_ELIM_CONV
# "!f n. (\m. f ((m = 0) => 0 | (m - 1))) (SUC n) < (f n) + 1";;
|- (!f n. ((\m. f((m = 0) => 0 | m - 1))(SUC n)) < ((f n) + 1)) =
   (!f n. ((\m. ((m = 0) => f 0 | f(m - 1)))(SUC n)) < ((f n) + 1))
}
\USES
Useful as a preprocessor to decision procedures which do not allow natural
number subtraction in their argument formula.
