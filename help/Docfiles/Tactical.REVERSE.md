## `REVERSE`

``` hol4
Tactical.REVERSE : (tactic -> tactic)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverses the order of the generated subgoals.

The tactic `REVERSE T` is a tactic which applies `T` to a goal, and
reverses the order of the subgoals generated by `T`.

### Failure

The application of `REVERSE` to a tactic `T` never fails. The resulting
composite tactic `REVERSE T` fails when applied to a goal if and only if
`T` fails.

### Comments

Intended for use with `THEN1` to pick the 'easy' subgoal.

### Example

Given a goal

``` hol4
   G1 /\ G2
```

use

``` hol4
  CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
  THEN ...
```

if the first conjunct is easily dispatched with `T0`, and

``` hol4
  REVERSE CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
  THEN ...
```

if it is the second conjunct that yields.
