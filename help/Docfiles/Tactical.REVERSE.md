## `REVERSE` {#Tactical.REVERSE}


```
REVERSE : (tactic -> tactic)
```



Reverses the order of the generated subgoals.


The tactic `REVERSE T` is a tactic which applies `T` to a goal, and reverses
the order of the subgoals generated by `T`.

### Failure

The application of `REVERSE` to a tactic `T` never fails. The
resulting composite tactic `REVERSE T` fails when applied to a goal if
and only if `T` fails.

### Comments

Intended for use with `THEN1` to pick the ‘easy’ subgoal.

### Example

Given a goal
    
       G1 /\ G2
    
use
    
      CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
      THEN ...
    
if the first conjunct is easily dispatched with `T0`, and
    
      REVERSE CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
      THEN ...
    
if it is the second conjunct that yields.
