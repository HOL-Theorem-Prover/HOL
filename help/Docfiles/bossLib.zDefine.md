## `zDefine` {#bossLib.zDefine}


```
zDefine : term quotation -> thm
```



General-purpose function definition facility.


`zDefine` behaves exactly like `Define`, except that it does not add the definition to `computeLib.the_compset`.  Consequently the definition is not used by `bossLib.EVAL` when evaluating expressions.



### Failure

`zDefine` and `Define` succeed and fail in the same way.



### Example

    
    - zDefine `foo = 10 ** 10 ** 10`
    - EVAL ``foo``;
    > val it = |- foo = foo: thm
    



### Comments

`zDefine` is helpful when users wish to derive and use their own efficient evaluation theorems, which can be added using `computeLib.add_funs` or `computeLib.add_persistent_funs`.
