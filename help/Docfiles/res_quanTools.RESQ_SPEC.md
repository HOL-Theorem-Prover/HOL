## `RESQ_SPEC` {#res_quanTools.RESQ_SPEC}


```
RESQ_SPEC : (term -> thm -> thm)
```



Specializes the conclusion of a restricted universally quantified theorem.


When applied to a term `u` and a theorem `A |- !x::P. t`, `RESQ_SPEC` returns
the theorem `A, P u |- t[u/x]`. If necessary, variables will be renamed prior
to the specialization to ensure that `u` is free for `x` in `t`, that is,
no variables free in `u` become bound after substitution.
    
          A |- !x::P. t
       ------------------  RESQ_SPEC "u"
        A, P u |- t[u/x]
    

### Failure

Fails if the theoremâ€™s conclusion is not restricted universally quantified,
or if type instantiation fails.

### Example

The following example shows how `RESQ_SPEC` renames bound variables if necessary,
prior to substitution: a straightforward substitution would result in the
clearly invalid theorem `(\y. 0 < y)y |- y = y`.
    
       #let th = RESQ_GEN "x:num" "\y.0<y" (REFL "x:num");;
       th = |- !x :: \y. 0 < y. x = x
    
       #RESQ_SPEC "y:num" th;;
       (\y'. 0 < y')y |- y = y
