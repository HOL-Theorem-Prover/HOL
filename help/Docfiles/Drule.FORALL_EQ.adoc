FORALL_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)

SYNOPSIS
Universally quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal, equality.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a variable {x} and a theorem {A |- t1 = t2}, whose conclusion
is an equation between boolean terms, {FORALL_EQ} returns the
theorem {A |- (!x. t1) = (!x. t2)}, unless the variable {x} is free in any
of the assumptions.

         A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------  FORALL_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (!x.t1) = (!x.t2)




FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not an equation between boolean terms, or if the
supplied term is not simply a variable, or if the variable is free in any of
the assumptions.

SEEALSO
Thm.AP_TERM, Drule.EXISTS_EQ, Drule.SELECT_EQ.
