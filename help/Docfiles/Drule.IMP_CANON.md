## `IMP_CANON` {#Drule.IMP_CANON}


```
IMP_CANON : (thm -> thm list)
```



Puts theorem into a ‘canonical’ form.


`IMP_CANON` puts a theorem in ‘canonical’ form by removing quantifiers
and breaking apart conjunctions, as well as disjunctions which form the
antecedent of implications. It applies the following transformation rules:
    
          A |- t1 /\ t2           A |- !x. t           A |- (t1 /\ t2) ==> t
       -------------------       ------------         ------------------------
        A |- t1   A |- t2           A |- t             A |- t1 ==> (t2 ==> t)
    
            A |- (t1 \/ t2) ==> t              A |- (?x. t1) ==> t2
       -------------------------------        ----------------------
        A |- t1 ==> t   A |- t2 ==> t          A |- t1[x'/x] ==> t2
    



### Failure

Never fails, but if there is no scope for one of the above reductions,
merely gives a list whose only member is the original theorem.

### Comments

This is a rather ad-hoc inference rule, and its use is not recommended.
