## `LIST_MP` {#Drule.LIST_MP}


```
LIST_MP : thm list -> thm -> thm
```



Performs a chain of Modus Ponens inferences.


When applied to theorems `A1 |- t1, ..., An |- tn` and a theorem which is a
chain of implications with the successive antecedents the same as the
conclusions of the theorems in the list (up to alpha-conversion),
`A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t`, the `LIST_MP` inference rule performs a chain
of `MP` inferences to deduce `A u A1 u ... u An |- t`.
    
        A1 |- t1 ... An |- tn      A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t
       ---------------------------------------------------------  LIST_MP
                        A u A1 u ... u An |- t
    



### Failure

Fails unless the theorem is a chain of implications whose consequents are the
same as the conclusions of the list of theorems (up to alpha-conversion), in
sequence.
