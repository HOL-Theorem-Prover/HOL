## `disch` {#HolKernel.disch}


```
disch : ((term * term list) -> term list)
```



Removes those elements of a list of terms that are alpha equivalent to a
given term.


Given a pair `(t,tl)` of term `t` and term list `tl`, `disch` removes
those elements of `tl` that are  alpha equivalent to `t`.

### Example

    
    > disch (``\x:bool.T``, [``A = T``, ``B = 3``, ``\y:bool.T``]);
    val it = [``A = T``,``B = 3``] : term list
