## `SELECT_RULE` {#Drule.SELECT_RULE}


```
SELECT_RULE : thm -> thm
```



Introduces an epsilon term in place of an existential quantifier.


The inference rule `SELECT_RULE` expects a theorem asserting the
existence of a value `x` such that `P` holds.  The equivalent assertion
that the epsilon term `@x.P` denotes a value of `x` for
which `P` holds is returned as a theorem.
    
           A |- ?x. P
       ------------------  SELECT_RULE
        A |- P[(@x.P)/x]
    



### Failure

Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
existentially quantified.

### Example

The axiom `INFINITY_AX` in the theory `ind` is of the form:
    
       |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f
    
Applying `SELECT_RULE` to this theorem returns the following.
    
       - SELECT_RULE INFINITY_AX;
       > val it =
         |- ONE_ONE (@f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f) /\ ~ONTO @f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f
         : thm
    
    




May be used to introduce an epsilon term to permit rewriting with a
constant defined using the epsilon operator.
