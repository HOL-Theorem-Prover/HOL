## `SELECT_CONV` {#Conv.SELECT_CONV}


```
SELECT_CONV : conv
```



Eliminates an epsilon term by introducing an existential quantifier.


The conversion `SELECT_CONV` expects a boolean term of the form
`P[@x.P[x]/x]`, which asserts that the epsilon term `@x.P[x]` denotes
a value, `x` say, for which `P[x]` holds.  This assertion is equivalent
to saying that there exists such a value, and `SELECT_CONV` applied to a
term of this form returns the theorem `|- P[@x.P[x]/x] = ?x. P[x]`.

### Failure

Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form `P[@x.P[x]/x]`.

### Example

    
    SELECT_CONV (Term `(@n. n < m) < m`);
    val it = |- (@n. n < m) < m = (?n. n < m) : thm
    




Particularly useful in conjunction with `CONV_TAC` for proving properties
of values denoted by epsilon terms.  For example, suppose that one wishes
to prove the goal
    
       ([0 < m], (@n. n < m) < SUC m)
    
Using the built-in arithmetic theorem
    
       LESS_SUC  |- !m n. m < n ==> m < (SUC n)
    
this goal may be reduced by the tactic `MATCH_MP_TAC LESS_SUC` to
the subgoal
    
       ([0 < m], (@n. n < m) < m)
    
This is now in the correct form for using `CONV_TAC SELECT_CONV` to
eliminate the epsilon term, resulting in the existentially quantified goal
    
       ([0 < m], ?n. n < m)
    
which is then straightforward to prove.
