## `delta` {#Lib.delta}


```
type 'a delta
```



A type used for telling when a function has changed its argument.


The `delta` type is declared as follows:
    
       datatype 'a delta = SAME | DIFF of 'a
    
The `delta` type may be used in applications where it is
important to tell if a function has changed its argument or not. As an
example of this, consider mapping a function over a large collection of
elements. If only a few elements are changed, it makes sense to re-use
all those that were not changed. This can of course be handled on an
ad hoc basis; the `delta` type provides a mechanism for doing this
systematically.

### Comments

The `delta` type is an example of polytypism.
