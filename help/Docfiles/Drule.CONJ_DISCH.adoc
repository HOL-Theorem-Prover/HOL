CONJ_DISCH : (term -> thm -> thm)

SYNOPSIS
Discharges an assumption and conjoins it to both sides of an equation.

KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction, assumption.

DESCRIBE
Given an term {t} and a theorem {A |- t1 = t2}, which is an equation between
boolean terms, {CONJ_DISCH} returns {A - {t} |- (t /\ t1) = (t /\ t2)}, i.e.
conjoins {t} to both sides of the equation, removing {t} from the assumptions
if it was there.

            A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------------  CONJ_DISCH "t"
    A - {t} |- t /\ t1 = t /\ t2




FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is an equation, both sides of which, and the term
provided are of type {bool}.
