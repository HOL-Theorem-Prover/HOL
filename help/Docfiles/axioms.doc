\TYPE {axioms : (string -> (string # thm) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the axioms of a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {axioms "thy"} returns the axioms of the theory segment {thy} together
with their names. The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current theory.
The names are those given to the axioms by the user when they were originally
added to the theory segment (by a call to {new_axiom}). The name of the current
theory segment can be abbreviated by {"-"}.

\FAILURE
The call {axioms "thy"} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not
part of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
- axioms"bool";

val it =
  [("INFINITY_AX",|- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~(ONTO f)),
   ("SELECT_AX",|- !P x. P x ==> P ($@ P)),
   ("ETA_AX",|- !t. (\x. t x) = t),
   ("IMP_ANTISYM_AX",|- !t1 t2. (t1 ==> t2) ==> (t2 ==> t1) ==> (t1 = t2)),
   ("BOOL_CASES_AX",|- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F))] : (string * thm) list
}
