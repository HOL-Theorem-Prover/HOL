## `RATOR_CONV` {#Conv.RATOR_CONV}


```
RATOR_CONV : (conv -> conv)
```



Applies a conversion to the operator of an application.


If `c` is a conversion that maps a term `"t1"` to the theorem `|- t1 = t1'`,
then the conversion `RATOR_CONV c` maps applications of the form `"t1 t2"` to
theorems of the form:
    
       |- (t1 t2) = (t1' t2)
    
That is, `RATOR_CONV c "t1 t2"` applies `c` to the operand of the
application `"t1 t2"`.

### Failure

`RATOR_CONV c tm` fails if `tm` is not an application or if `tm` has the form
`"t1 t2"` but the conversion `c` fails when applied to the term `t1`. The
function returned by `RATOR_CONV c` may also fail if the ML function
`c:term->thm` is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term
`t` to a theorem `|- t = t'`).

### Example

    
    - RATOR_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\x y. x + y) 1 2`);
    > val it = |- (\x y. x + y)1 2 = (\y. 1 + y) 2 : thm
