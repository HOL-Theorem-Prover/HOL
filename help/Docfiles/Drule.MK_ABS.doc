\TYPE {MK_ABS : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Abstracts both sides of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, abstraction, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t1 = t2}, whose conclusion is a
universally quantified equation, {MK_ABS} returns the theorem
{A |- \x. t1 = \x. t2}.
{
        A |- !x. t1 = t2
   --------------------------  MK_ABS
    A |- (\x. t1) = (\x. t2)
}


\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a (singly) universally quantified equation.
