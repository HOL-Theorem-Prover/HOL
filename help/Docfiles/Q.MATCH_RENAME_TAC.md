## `MATCH_RENAME_TAC` {#Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC}


```
Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC : term quotation -> tactic
```



Replaces selected terms with new variables by matching a pattern against the goal statement.


When applied to the goal `(asl, w)`, the tactic `Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC q ls`
parses the quotation `q` in the context of the goal, producing a term to use as
a pattern. The tactic then attempts a (first order) match of the pattern
against the term `w`.

For each variable `v` in the pattern, there will be an instantiation
term `t`, such that the substitution
    
       pattern[v1 |-> t1, v2 |-> t2, ...]
    
produces `w`. The effect of the tactic is to then replace each `t`
with the corresponding `v`, yielding a new goal. Note that underscores
within a pattern, though strictly speaking variables, are not included
in this reverse instantiation.

### Failure

`MATCH_RENAME_TAC` fails if the pattern provided does not match the
goal, or if variables from the goal are used in the pattern in ways
that make the pattern fail to type-check.

### Example

If the current goal is
    
       ?- (f x = Pair C'' C0') ==> (f C'' = f C0')
    
then applying the tactic `` Q.MATCH_RENAME_TAC `(f x = Pair c1 c2) ==> _` `` results in
the goal
    
       ?- (f x = Pair c1 c2) ==> (f c1 = f c2)
    

### Comments

This tactic is equivalent to first applying `Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC q`, then
applying `` Q.RM_ABBREV_TAC `v` `` for each underscore in `q`.
