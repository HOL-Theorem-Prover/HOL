\DOC tyvarsl

\TYPE {tyvarsl : (term list -> type list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the type variables free in a list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a list of terms, {tyvarsl}
returns a list (possibly empty) of the type variables which are free in
any of those terms.

\FAILURE
Never fails. The function is not accessible unless the hol88 library has 
been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - tyvarsl [--`!x. x = 1`--, --`!x:'a. x = x`--];
  [(==`:'a`==)] : hol_type list
}


\USES
Finding all the free type variables in the assumptions of a theorem, as a check
on the validity of certain inferences.

\COMMENTS
{tyvarsl} does not appear in hol90. In the current HOL logic, there is no 
binding operation for types, so `is free in' is synonymous with `appears in'.
