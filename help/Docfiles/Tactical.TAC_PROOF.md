## `TAC_PROOF` {#Tactical.TAC_PROOF}


```
TAC_PROOF : goal * tactic -> thm
```



Attempts to prove a goal using a given tactic.


When applied to a goal-tactic pair `(A ?- t,tac)`, the `TAC_PROOF` function
attempts to prove the goal `A ?- t`, using the tactic `tac`. If it succeeds, it
returns the theorem `A' |- t` corresponding to the goal, where the assumption
list `A'` may be a proper superset of `A` unless the tactic is valid; there
is no inbuilt validity checking.

### Failure

Fails unless the goal has hypotheses and conclusions all of type `bool`,
and the tactic can solve the goal.
