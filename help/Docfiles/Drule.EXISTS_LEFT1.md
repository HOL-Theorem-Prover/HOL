## `EXISTS_LEFT1` {#Drule.EXISTS_LEFT1}


```
EXISTS_LEFT1 : term -> thm -> thm
```



Existentially quantifes hypotheses of a theorem.


In this example, assume that `h1` and `h3` (only) involve the free variable `x`.
    
          h1, h2, h3 |- t
       --------------------- EXISTS_LEFT1 ``x``
       ?x. h1 /\ h3, h2 |- t
    

### Failure

`EXISTS_LEFT1` will fail unless the term supplied is a free variable
which appears in one or more hypotheses but not the conclusion of the given
theorem

### Example

Where `th` is `[p, q, g x, h y, f x y] |- r`, and `fvx` and `fvy` are
``` ``x`` ``` and ``` ``y`` ```,

`EXISTS_LEFT1 fvx th` is `[p, q, h y, ?x. g x /\ f x y] |- r`

`EXISTS_LEFT1 fvy th` is `[p, q, g x, ?y. h y /\ f x y] |- r`

### Comments

`EXISTS_LEFT1 fv` is just like `EXISTS_LEFT [fv]` except that
`EXISTS_LEFT1 fv` fails where `EXISTS_LEFT [fv]` returns the theorem unchanged

See `EXISTS_LEFT` for further discussion
