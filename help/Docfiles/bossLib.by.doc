\TYPE {op by : term quotation * tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove and place a theorem on the assumptions of the goal.

\DESCRIBE
An invocation {tm by tac}, when applied to goal {A ?- g}, applies {tac} 
to goal {A ?- tm}. If {tm} is thereby proved, it is added to {A}, 
yielding the new goal {A,tm ?- g}.  If {tm} is not proved by {tac}, 
then any remaining subgoals generated are added to {A,tm ?- g}.

When {tm} is added to the existing assumptions {A}, it is "stripped", 
i.e., broken apart by eliminating existentials, conjunctions, 
and disjunctions. This can lead to case splitting.

\FAILURE
Fails if {tac} fails when applied to {A ?- tm}.

\EXAMPLE
Given the goal {{x <= y, w < x} ?- P}, suppose that the fact
{?n. y = n + w} would help in eventually proving {P}. Invoking
{
   `?n. y = n + w` by (EXISTS_TAC ``y-w`` THEN DECIDE_TAC)
}
yields the goal {{y = n + w, x <= y, w < x} ?- P} in which the proved
fact has been added to the assumptions after its existential quantifier 
is eliminated. Note the parentheses around the tactic: this is needed
for the example because {by} binds more tightly than {THEN}.

Since the tactic supplied need not solve the generated subgoal, {by} 
gives a useful way of generating proof obligations while pursuing a 
particular line of reasoning. For example, the above goal could also be
attacked by 
{
   `?n. y = n + w` by ALL_TAC
}
with the result being the goal {{x <= y, w < x} ?- ?n. y = n + w} 
and the augmented original {{y = n + w, x <= y, w < x} ?- P}. Now either 
may be attempted.

\COMMENTS
Use of {by} can be more convenient than {IMP_RES_TAC} and {RES_TAC}
when they would generate many useless assumptions.
