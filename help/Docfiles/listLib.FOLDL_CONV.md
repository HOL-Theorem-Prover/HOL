## `FOLDL_CONV` {#listLib.FOLDL_CONV}


```
FOLDL_CONV : conv -> conv
```



Computes by inference the result of applying a function to the elements of a
list.


`FOLDL_CONV` takes a conversion `conv` and a term `tm` in the following form:
    
       FOLDL f e [x0;...xn]
    
It returns the theorem
    
       |- FOLDL f e [x0;...xn] = tm'
    
where `tm'` is the result of applying the function `f` iteratively to
the successive elements of the list and the result of the previous
application starting from the tail end of the list. During each
iteration, an expression `f ei xi` is evaluated. The user supplied
conversion `conv` is used to derive a theorem
    
       |- f ei xi = e(i+1)
    
which is used in the next iteration.

### Failure

`FOLDL_CONV conv tm` fails if `tm` is not of the form described above.

### Example

To sum the elements of a list,  one can use
`FOLDL_CONV` with `REDUCE_CONV` from the library `numLib`.
    
       - FOLDL_CONV numLib.REDUCE_CONV ``FOLDL $+ 0 [0;1;2;3]``;
       val it = |- FOLDL $+ 0 [0;1;2;3] = 6 : thm
    
In general, if the function `f` is an explicit lambda abstraction
`(\x x'. t[x,x'])`, the conversion should be in the form
    
       ((RATOR_CONV BETA_CONV) THENC BETA_CONV THENC conv'))
    
where `conv'` applied to `t[x,x']` returns the theorem
    
       |-t[x,x'] = e''.
