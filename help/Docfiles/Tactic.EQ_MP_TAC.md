## `EQ_MP_TAC` {#Tactic.EQ_MP_TAC}


```
EQ_MP_TAC : thm -> tactic
```



A tactic that reverses `EQ_MP`, requiring proof of an equality.


A call to `EQ_MP_TAC th`, with `th`’s conclusion being boolean term
`p`, changes a goal `(G, q)` to be `(G,p <=> q)`. If `p <=> q` is
indeed provable, then an application of `EQ_MP` to that theorem and
the provided `th` will be a proof of `q` (all in the context of
assumptions `G`).

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    > EQ_MP_TAC (CONJ TRUTH TRUTH) ([], “p ∧ q”);
    val it = ([([], “T ∧ T ⇔ p ∧ q”)], fn):
       (term list * term) list * (thm list -> thm)
    

### Comments

Application of this tactic might be a prelude to showing that a number
of sub-terms from the theorem’s conclusion and the goal are equal
(with tactics such as `AP_TERM_TAC` and `CONG_TAC`).
