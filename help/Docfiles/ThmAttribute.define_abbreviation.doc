define_abbreviation : {
  abbrev : string,
  expansion : (string * string list) list
} -> unit
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Defines an abbreviation expanding to multiple attributes

\DESCRIBE
A call to {define_abbreviation{abbrev=a,expansion=e}} modifies the
handling of theorem attributes so that when attributes attached to
theorem names are parsed, the string {a} will be replaced by the
expansion {e}. If the abbreviation string is accompanied by arguments,
these are silently dropped.

\FAILURE
A call to {define_abbreviation{abbrev,expansion}} will fail if the
{abbrev} name is already in use as an attribute or reserved word.

\COMMENTS
These abbreviations do not persist; they are meant to be a transient
convenience.
