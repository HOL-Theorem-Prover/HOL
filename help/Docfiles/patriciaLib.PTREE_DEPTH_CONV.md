## `PTREE_DEPTH_CONV` {#patriciaLib.PTREE_DEPTH_CONV}


```
PTREE_DEPTH_CONV : conv
```



Conversion for evaluating applications of `patricia$DEPTH`.


The conversion `PTREE_DEPTH_CONV` evaluates terms of the form `DEPTH t` where `t` is a well-formed Patricia tree (constructed by `patricia$Empty`, `patricia$Leaf` and `patricia$Branch`).

### Failure

The conversion will fail if the supplied term is not a suitable application of `patricia$DEPTH`.

### Example

    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_DEPTH_CONV ``DEPTH Empty``;
    > val it = |- DEPTH <{}> = 0: thm
    
    - patriciaLib.PTREE_DEPTH_CONV ``DEPTH (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1))``;
    > val it = |- DEPTH (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1)) = 2: thm
