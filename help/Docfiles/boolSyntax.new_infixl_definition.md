## `new_infixl_definition` {#boolSyntax.new_infixl_definition}


```
new_infixl_definition : string * term * int -> thm
```



Declares a new left associative infix constant and installs a
definition in the current theory.


The function `new_infix_definition` provides a facility for
definitional extensions to the current theory.  It takes a triple
consisting of the name under which the resulting definition will be
saved in the current theory segment, a term giving the desired
definition and an integer giving the precedence of the infix.  The
value returned by `new_infix_definition` is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.

Let `v_1` and `v_2` be tuples of distinct variables, containing the variables
`x_1,...,x_m`.  Evaluating `new_infix_definition (name, ix v_1 v_2 = t)`
declares the sequent `({},\v_1 v_2. t)` to be a definition in the
current theory, and declares `ix` to be a new constant in the
current theory with this definition as its specification.
This constant specification is returned as a theorem with the form
    
       |- !x_1 ... x_m. v_1 ix v_2 = t
    
and is saved in the current theory under
(the name) `name`.  Optionally, the definitional term argument
may have any of its variables universally quantified.
The constant `ix` has infix status only after the infix
declaration has been processed.  It is therefore necessary to use
the constant in normal prefix position when making the definition.

### Failure

`new_infixl_definition` fails if `t` contains free
variables that are not in either of the variable structures `v_1` and
`v_2` (this is equivalent to requiring `\v_1 v_2. t` to be a closed
term); or if any variable occurs more than once in `v_1, v_2`.  It
also fails if the precedence level chosen for the infix is already
home to parsing rules of a different form of fixity (infixes
associating in a different way, or suffixes, prefixes etc).  Finally,
failure occurs if there is a type variable in `v_1`, ..., `v_n` or `t`
that does not occur in the type of `ix`.

### Example

The nand function can be defined as follows.
    
       - new_infix_definition
        ("nand", “$nand in_1 in_2 = ~(in_1 /\ in_2)”, 500);;
       > val it = |- !in_1 in_2. in_1 nand in_2 = ~(in_1 /\ in_2) : thm
    



### Comments

It is a common practice among HOL users to write a `$` before
the constant being defined as an infix to indicate that after the
definition is made, it will have a special syntactic status; ie. to
write:
    
       new_infixl_definition("ix_DEF", Term `$ix m n = ... `)
    
This use of `$` is not necessary; but after the definition
has been made `$` must, of course, be used if the syntactic status
needs to be suppressed.

In releases of hol98 past Taupo 1, `new_infixl_definition` and its
sister `new_infixr_definition` replace the old `new_infix_definition`,
which has been superseded.  Its behaviour was to define a right
associative infix, so can be freely replaced by
`new_infixr_definition`.
