## `restore` {#proofManagerLib.restore}


```
restore : unit -> proof
```



Restores the proof state of the last save point, undoing the effects of expansions after the save point.


The function `restore` is part of the subgoal package. A call to `restore`
restores the proof state to the last save point (a proof state saved by
`save`). If the current state is a save point then `restore` clears the
current save point and returns to the last save point. If there are no save
points in the history, then `restore` returns to the initial goal and is
equivalent to `restart`. For a description of the subgoal package, see
`set_goal`.

### Failure

The function `restore` will fail only if no goalstack is being managed.


Back tracking in a goal-directed proof to a user-defined save point.
