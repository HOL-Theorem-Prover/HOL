## `P_FUN_EQ_CONV` {#PairRules.P_FUN_EQ_CONV}


```
P_FUN_EQ_CONV : (term -> conv)
```



Performs extensionality conversion for functions (function equality).


The conversion `P_FUN_EQ_CONV` embodies the fact that two functions are equal
precisely when they give the same results for all values to which they can be
applied. For any paired variable structure `"p"` and equation `"f = g"`,
where `p` is of type `ty1` and `f` and `g` are functions of type `ty1->ty2`,
a call to `P_FUN_EQ_CONV "p" "f = g"` returns the theorem:
    
       |- (f = g) = (!p. f p = g p)
    



### Failure

`P_FUN_EQ_CONV p tm` fails if `p` is not a paired structure of variables
or if `tm` is not an equation `f = g` where `f` and `g` are functions.
Furthermore, if `f` and `g` are functions of type `ty1->ty2`,
then the pair `x` must have type `ty1`; otherwise the conversion fails.
Finally, failure also occurs if any of the variables in `p` is free in either
`f` or `g`.
