## `decls` {#Type.decls}


```
decls : string -> {Thy : string, Tyop : string} list
```



Lists all theories a named type operator is declared in.


An invocation `Type.decls s` finds all theories in the ancestry of the
current theory with a type constant having the given name.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - Type.decls "prod";
    > val it = [{Thy = "pair", Tyop = "prod"}] : {Thy:string, Tyop:string} list
    



### Comments

There is also a function `Term.decls` that performs a similar
operation on term constants.
