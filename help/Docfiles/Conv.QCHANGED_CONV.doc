\DOC QCHANGED_CONV

\TYPE {QCHANGED_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a conversion fail if applying it raises the {UNCHANGED} exception.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion that maps a term {t} to a theorem {|- t = t'},
then so too is {QCHANGED_CONV c}.  If {c} applied to {t} raises the
special {UNCHANGED} exception used by conversions to indicate that
they haven't changed an input, then {QCHANGED_CONV c} will fail when
applied to {t}.

This behaviour is similar to that of {CHANGED_CONV}, except that that
conversion also fails if the conversion {c} returns a theorem when
applied to {t}, and if that theorem has alpha-convertible left and
right hand sides.

\FAILURE
{QCHANGED_CONV c t} fails if {c} applied {t} raises the {UNCHANGED}
exception, or if {c} fails when applied to {t}.

\USES
{QCHANGED_CONV} can be used in places where {CHANGED_CONV} is
appropriate, and where one knows that the conversion argument will not
return an instance of reflexivity, or if one does not mind this
occurring and not being trapped.  Because it is no more than an
exception handler, {QCHANGED_CONV} is very efficient.
