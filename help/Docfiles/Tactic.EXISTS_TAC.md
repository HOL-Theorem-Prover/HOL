## `EXISTS_TAC` {#Tactic.EXISTS_TAC}


```
EXISTS_TAC : (term -> tactic)
```



Reduces existentially quantified goal to one involving a specific witness.


When applied to a term `u` and a goal `?x. t`, the tactic
`EXISTS_TAC` reduces the goal to `t[u/x]` (substituting `u`
for all free instances of `x` in `t`, with variable renaming if
necessary to avoid free variable capture).
    
        A ?- ?x. t
       =============  EXISTS_TAC "u"
        A ?- t[u/x]
    



### Failure

Fails unless the goalâ€™s conclusion is existentially quantified and the
term supplied has the same type as the quantified variable in the goal.

### Example

The goal:
    
       ?- ?x. x=T
    
can be solved by:
    
       EXISTS_TAC ``T`` THEN REFL_TAC
