PTREE_DEFN_CONV : conv

SYNOPSIS
Conversion for evaluating applications of {ADD} and {REMOVE} to Patricia tree constants.

DESCRIBE
Given a constant {c} defined using {Define_mk_ptree}, the conversion {PTREE_DEFN_CONV} will evaluate term of the form {c |+ (k,x)}, {c \\ k} and {c} where {k} is a natural number literal.

EXAMPLE

- val ptree = Define_mk_ptree "ptree" (int_ptree_of_list [(1,``1``), (2, ``2``)]);
<<HOL message: Saved IS_PTREE theorem for new constant "ptree">>
val ptree = |- ptree = Branch 0 0 (Leaf 1 1) (Leaf 2 2): thm

- PTREE_DEFN_CONV ``ptree \\ 1``;
val it = |- ptree \\ 1 = Leaf 2 2: thm

- PTREE_DEFN_CONV ``ptree |+ (3,3)``;
val it =
   |- ptree |+ (3,3) =
   Branch 0 0 (Branch 1 1 (Leaf 3 3) (Leaf 1 1)) (Leaf 2 2):
   thm


COMMENTS
The conversion {PTREE_DEFN_CONV} has limited uses and is mostly used internally by the conversion {PTREE_CONV}.
