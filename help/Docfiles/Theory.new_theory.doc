\TYPE {new_theory : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Creates a new theory by extending the current theory with a new theory segment.

\DESCRIBE
A theory consists of a hierarchy of named parts called theory segments. The
theory segment at the top of the hierarchy tree in each theory is said to be
current. All theory segments have a theory of the same name  associated with
them consisting of the theory segment itself and all its ancestors.
Each axiom,
definition, specification and theorem belongs to a particular theory segment.

Calling {new_theory `thy`} creates a new theory segment and associated theory
having name {thy}. The theory segment which was current before the call becomes
a parent of the new theory segment. The new theory therefore consists of the
current theory extended with the new theory segment. The new theory segment
replaces its parent as the current theory segment. The call switches the system
into draft mode. This allows new axioms, constants, types, constant
specifications, infix constants, binders and parents to be added to the theory
segment. Inconsistencies will be introduced into the theory if inconsistent
axioms are asserted.  New theorems can also be added as when in proof mode. The
theory file in which the data of the new theory segment is ultimately stored
will have name {thy.th} in the directory from which HOL was called. The theory
segment might not be written to this file until the session is finished with a
call to {close_theory}. If HOL is quitted without closing the session with
{close_theory}, parts of the theory segment created during the session may be
lost. If the system is in draft mode when a call to {new_theory} is made, the
previous session is closed; all changes made in it will be written to the
associated theory file.

\FAILURE
The call {new_theory `thy`} will fail if there already exists a file {thy.th}
in the current search path. It will also fail if the name {thy.th} is
unsuitable for a filename. Since it could involve writing to the file system,
if a write fails for any reason {new_theory} will fail.

\USES
Hierarchically extending the current theory.
By splitting a theory into theory segments using {new_theory}, the work
required if definitions, etc., need to be changed is minimized. Only the
associated segment and its descendants need be redefined.
