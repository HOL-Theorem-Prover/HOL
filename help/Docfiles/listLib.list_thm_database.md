## `list_thm_database` {#listLib.list_thm_database}


```
list_thm_database: unit -> {{Aux_thms: thm list, Fold_thms: thm list}}
```



Returns the theorems known by `LIST_CONV`.


The conversion `LIST_CONV` uses a database of theorems relating to system list
constants. These theorems fall into two categories: definitions of list
operators in terms of `FOLDR` and `FOLDL`; and auxiliary theorems about the
base element and step functions in those definitions. `list_thm_database` provides a means of inspecting the database.

A call to `list_thm_database()` returns a pair of lists. The first element of
the pair contains the known fold definitions. The second contains the known
auxiliary theorems.

The  following is an example of a fold definition in the database:
    
       |- !l. SUM l = FOLDR $+ 0 l
    
Here `$+` is the step function and 0 is the base element of the
definition. Definitions are initially held for the following system operators:
`APPEND`, `FLAT`, `LENGTH`, `NULL`, `REVERSE`, `MAP`, `FILTER`, `ALL_EL`,
`SUM`, `SOME_EL`, `IS_EL`, `AND_EL`, `OR_EL`, `PREFIX`, `SUFFIX`, `SNOC` and
`FLAT` combined with `REVERSE`.

The following is an example of an auxiliary theorem:
    
       |- MONOID $+ 0
    
Auxiliary theorems stored include monoid, commutativity,
associativity, binary function commutativity, left identity and right identity
theorems.
