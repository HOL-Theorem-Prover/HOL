## `DISJ_CASES_THENL` {#Thm_cont.DISJ_CASES_THENL}


```
DISJ_CASES_THENL : (thm_tactic list -> thm_tactic)
```



Applies theorem-tactics in a list to the corresponding disjuncts in a theorem.


If the theorem-tactics `f1...fn` applied to the `ASSUME`d disjuncts of a
theorem
    
       |- d1 \/ d2 \/...\/ dn
    
produce results as follows when applied to a goal `(A ?- t)`:
    
        A ?- t                                A ?- t
       =========  f1 (d1 |- d1) and ... and =========  fn (dn |- dn)
        A ?- t1                              A ?- tn
    
then applying `DISJ_CASES_THENL [f1;...;fn] (|- d1 \/...\/ dn)`
to the goal `(A ?- t)` produces n subgoals.
    
               A ?- t
       =======================  DISJ_CASES_THENL [f1;...;fn] (|- d1 \/...\/ dn)
        A ?- t1  ...  A ?- tn
    
`DISJ_CASES_THENL` is defined using iteration, hence for
theorems with more than `n` disjuncts, `dn` would itself be disjunctive.

### Failure

Fails if the number of tactic generating functions in the list exceeds
the number of disjuncts in the theorem.  An invalid tactic is
produced if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to an assumption of the goal.


Used when the goal is to be split into several cases, where a
different tactic-generating function is to be applied to each case.
