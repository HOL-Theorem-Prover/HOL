## `POP_ASSUM_LIST` {#Tactical.POP_ASSUM_LIST}


```
POP_ASSUM_LIST : (thm list -> tactic) -> tactic
```



Generates a tactic from the assumptions, discards the assumptions and
applies the tactic.


When applied to a function and a goal, `POP_ASSUM_LIST` applies
the function to a list of theorems corresponding to the `ASSUME`d
assumptions of the goal, then applies the resulting tactic to the goal
with an empty assumption list.
    
        POP_ASSUM_LIST f ({A1,...,An} ?- t) = f [A1 |- A1, ..., An |- An] (?- t)
    



### Failure

Fails if the function fails when applied to the list of `ASSUME`d assumptions,
or if the resulting tactic fails when applied to the goal with no
assumptions.

### Comments

There is nothing magical about `POP_ASSUM_LIST`: the same effect can be
achieved by using `ASSUME a` explicitly wherever the assumption `a` is
used. If `POP_ASSUM_LIST` is used, it is unwise to select elements by
number from the `ASSUME`d-assumption list, since this introduces a dependency
on ordering.

### Example

Suppose we have a goal of the following form:
    
       {a /\ b, c, (d /\ e) /\ f} ?- t
    
Then we can split the conjunctions in the assumption list apart by
applying the tactic:
    
       POP_ASSUM_LIST (MAP_EVERY STRIP_ASSUME_TAC)
    
which results in the new goal:
    
       {a, b, c, d, e, f} ?- t
    




Making more delicate use of the assumption list than simply rewriting or
using resolution.
