## `PFORALL_IMP_CONV` {#PairRules.PFORALL_IMP_CONV}


```
PFORALL_IMP_CONV : conv
```



Moves a paired universal quantification inwards through an implication.


When applied to a term of the form `!p. t ==> u`, where variables from `p`
are not free in both `t` and `u`, `PFORALL_IMP_CONV` returns a theorem of
one of three forms, depending on occurrences of the variables from `p` in `t`
and `u`.  If variables from `p` are free in `t` but none are in `u`,
then the theorem:
    
       |- (!p. t ==> u) = (?p. t) ==> u
    
is returned.  If variables from `p` are free in `u` but none are
in `t`, then the result is:
    
       |- (!p. t ==> u) = t ==> (!p. u)
    
And if no variable from `p` is free in either `t` nor `u`,
then the result is:
    
       |- (!p. t ==> u) = (?p. t) ==> (!p. u)
    



### Failure

`PFORALL_IMP_CONV` fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
`!p. t ==> u`, or if it is applied to a term `!p. t ==> u` in which
variables from `p` are free in both `t` and `u`.
