List unmapped elements in compset


The function `unmapped` takes a `compset` value and returns a
listing of the elements of the compset that have no transformation 
attached to them.

### Example

The listing omits constructors, but can include constants
that effectively act as constructors for rewrites in the compset. 
    
       > val compset = reduceLib.num_compset();
       val compset = <compset>: computeLib.compset
    
       > computeLib.unmapped compset;
       val it =
         [("BIT1", "arithmetic"), 
          ("BIT2", "arithmetic"),
          ("ZERO", "arithmetic")]
         : (string * string) list
    

### Example

In the following example, a function is added to a compset without 
also adding functions that get "called" by it:
    
       > load "sortingTheory";
       val it = (): unit
    
      > sortingTheory.QSORT_DEF;
      val it =
         |- (!ord. QSORT ord [] = []) /\
            !t ord h.
              QSORT ord (h::t) =
               (let (l1,l2) = PARTITION (\y. ord y h) t
               in
               QSORT ord l1 ++ [h] ++ QSORT ord l2) : thm
    
       > val () = computeLib.add_thms [sortingTheory.QSORT_DEF] compset;
    
       > computeLib.unmapped compset;
       val it =
          [("APPEND", "list"), 
           ("BIT1", "arithmetic"), 
           ("BIT2", "arithmetic"),
           ("PARTITION", "sorting"), 
           ("UNCURRY", "pair"), 
           ("ZERO", "arithmetic")]
       :(string * string) list
    

### Comments

Intended to support the construction of large compsets, where it is often
unclear what functions and conversions still need to be added in order to 
make applications of `EVAL_CONV` terminate.

### Failure

Never fails.
