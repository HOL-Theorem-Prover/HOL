## `exec_script` {#smlExecScripts.exec_script}


```
exec_script : string -> unit
```



Execute the script given in the file `f`.


The script is executed only for its side effects.
The execution standard out is redirected to
`src/AI/sml_inspection/buildheap/buildheap_yourscript` where yourscript is
the basename of `f` without extension. This file is worth expecting to debug
uncaught errors.

### Failure

Never fails.



### Example

    
    - load "aiLib"; open aiLib;
    - load "smlExecScripts"; open smlExecScripts;
    (* output omitted *)
    > val it = () : unit
    
    val dir = HOLDIR ^ "/src/AI/sml_inspection"; (* user can choose *)
    val scriptin = dir ^ "/script.sml";
    val scriptout = dir ^ "/script-out";
    (* output omitted *)
    
    - writel scriptin
      ["load \"aiLib\"; open aiLib;",
       String.concatWith " " ["writel", mlquote scriptout, "[\"hello world!\"]"]];
    > val it = (): unit
    
    - exec_script scriptin;
    > val it = (): unit
    
    - readl "script-out";
    > val it = ["hello world!"]: string list
    

### Comments

An Holmakefile might be placed in the same directory as the script to help
`exec_script` (`heapname`,`genscriptdep`) figure out the dependencies of the
script. For example, a Holmakefile might include the line 
`INCLUDES = path-to-your-dependency`.
