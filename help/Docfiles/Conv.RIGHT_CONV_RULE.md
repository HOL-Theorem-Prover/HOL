## `RIGHT_CONV_RULE` {#Conv.RIGHT_CONV_RULE}


```
RIGHT_CONV_RULE : (conv -> thm -> thm)
```



Applies a conversion to the right-hand side of an equational theorem.


If `c` is a conversion that maps a term `"t2"` to the theorem `|- t2 = t2'`,
then the rule `RIGHT_CONV_RULE c` infers `|- t1 = t2'` from the theorem
`|- t1 = t2`.  That is, if  `c "t2"` returns `A' |- t2 = t2'`, then:
    
           A |- t1 = t2
       ---------------------  RIGHT_CONV_RULE c
        A u A' |- t1 = t2'
    
Note that if the conversion `c` returns a theorem with assumptions,
then the resulting inference rule adds these to the assumptions of the
theorem it returns.

### Failure

`RIGHT_CONV_RULE c th` fails if the conclusion of the theorem `th` is not an
equation, or if `th` is an equation but `c` fails when applied its right-hand
side. The function returned by `RIGHT_CONV_RULE c` will also fail if the ML
function `c:term->thm` is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps
a term `t` to a theorem `|- t = t'`).
