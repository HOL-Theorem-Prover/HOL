## `THEN_LT`

``` hol4
op Tactical.THEN_LT : tactic * list_tactic -> tactic
op THEN_LT : list_tactic * list_tactic -> list_tactic
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applies a list-tactic to the corresponding subgoals generated by a
tactic or by a previous list-tactic.

If `tac` is a tactic and `ltac` is a list-tactic, then
`tac THEN_LT ltac` is a tactic which applies `tac` to a goal, and if it
does not fail, applies the list-tactic `ltac` to the resulting list of
subgoals.

If `ltac1` and `ltac2` are list-tactics, then `ltac1 THEN_LT ltac2` is a
list-tactic which applies `ltac1` to a goal list, and if it does not
fail, applies `ltac2` to the resulting list of goals.

### Failure

The application of `THEN_LT` to a tactic or list-tactic and a
list-tactic never fails.

The tactic `tac THEN_LT ltac` fails if `tac` fails when applied to the
goal, or if `ltac` fails when applied to the resulting subgoal list.

The list-tactic `ltac1 THEN_LT ltac2` fails if `ltac1` fails when
applied to the goal list, or if `ltac2` fails when applied to the goal
list result of `ltac1`.

Applying a combination of tactics to a list of subgoals, or otherwise
manipulating a list of subgoals.

### Example

Where `tac1` and `tac2` are tactics, `tac1 THEN_LT ALLGOALS tac2` is
equivalent to `tac1 THEN tac2`

Where `tac1` is a tactic and `tacs2` is a list of tactics,
`tac1 THEN_LT NULL_OK_LT (TACS_TO_LT tacs2)` is equivalent to
`tac1 THENL tacs2`

Where `tac` is a tactic, `tac THEN_LT REVERSE_LT` is equivalent to
`REVERSE tac`
