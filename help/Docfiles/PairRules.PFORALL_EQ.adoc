PFORALL_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)

KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal, equality.

LIBRARY
pair

SYNOPSIS
Universally quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p}
and a theorem

    A |- t1 = t2


whose conclusion is an equation between boolean terms:

    PFORALL_EQ


returns the theorem:

    A |- (!p. t1) = (!p. t2)


unless any of the variables in {p} is free in any of the assumptions.

          A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  PFORALL_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (!p. t1) = (!p. t2)




FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not an equation between boolean terms, or if the
supplied term is not a paired structure of variables, or if any of the
variables in the supplied pair is free in any of the assumptions.
