\DOC MP_CONV

\TYPE {MP_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminate the antecedent of a theorem using a conversion/proof rule.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, implication.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion that when applied to {P} returns the theorem
{|- P = T} or {|- P}, and {th} is a theorem of the general form {|- P ==> Q},
then {MP_CONV c th} will return the theorem {|- Q}, i.e. the antecedent
of {th} is eliminated by the conversion {c}. This is done by calling
{MP} on {|- P ==> Q} and {|- P}.

\FAILURE
{MP_CONV c th} will fail if {th} is not of the form {|- P ==> Q} or
if {c} fails when applied to {P}.

\EXAMPLE
{
- load "realLib"; open realTheory realLib;
- MP_CONV REAL_ARITH (Q.SPEC `1` REAL_DOWN);
> val it = |- ?y. 0 < y /\ y < 1: thm
}

\COMMENTS
This conversion is ported from HOL-Light ({drule.ml}). {MP_CONV} is useful when
a universal theorem, after instantiating some of its quantifiers, the antecedent
becomes a tautology that can be eliminated by a conversion.
