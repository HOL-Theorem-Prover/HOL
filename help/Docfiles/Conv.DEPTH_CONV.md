## `DEPTH_CONV` {#Conv.DEPTH_CONV}


```
DEPTH_CONV : conv -> conv
```



Applies a conversion repeatedly to all the sub-terms of a term, in bottom-up
order.


`DEPTH_CONV c tm` repeatedly applies the conversion `c` to all the subterms of
the term `tm`, including the term `tm` itself.  The supplied conversion is
applied repeatedly (zero or more times, as is done by `REPEATC`) to each
subterm until it fails. The conversion is applied to subterms in bottom-up
order.

### Failure

`DEPTH_CONV c tm` never fails but can diverge if the conversion `c` can be
applied repeatedly to some subterm of `tm` without failing.

### Example

The following example shows how `DEPTH_CONV` applies a conversion to all
subterms to which it applies:
    
       - DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2`);
       > val it = |- (\x. (\y. y + x)1)2 = 1 + 2 : thm
    
Here, there are two beta-redexes in the input term, one of which
occurs within the other. `DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV` applies beta-conversion to
innermost beta-redex `(\y. y + x) 1` first.  The outermost beta-redex is then
`(\x. 1 + x) 2`, and beta-conversion of this redex gives `1 + 2`.

Because `DEPTH_CONV` applies a conversion bottom-up, the final result may still
contain subterms to which the supplied conversion applies.  For example, in:
    
       - DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\f x. (f x) + 1) (\y.y) 2`);
       > val it = |- (\f x. (f x) + 1)(\y. y)2 = ((\y. y)2) + 1 : thm
    
the right-hand side of the result still contains a beta-redex,
because the redex `(\y.y)2` is introduced by virtue of an application of
`BETA_CONV` higher-up in the structure of the input term.  By contrast,
in the example:
    
       - DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\f x. (f x)) (\y.y) 2`);
       > val it = |- (\f x. f x)(\y. y)2 = 2 : thm
    
all beta-redexes are eliminated, because `DEPTH_CONV` repeats the
supplied conversion (in this case, `BETA_CONV`) at each subterm (in this case,
at the top-level term).


If the conversion `c` implements the evaluation of a function in logic, then
`DEPTH_CONV c` will do bottom-up evaluation of nested applications of it.
For example, the conversion `ADD_CONV` implements addition of natural number
constants within the logic. Thus, the effect of:
    
       - DEPTH_CONV reduceLib.ADD_CONV (Term `(1 + 2) + (3 + 4 + 5)`);
       > val it = |- (1 + 2) + (3 + (4 + 5)) = 15 : thm
    
is to compute the sum represented by the input term.

### Comments

The implementation of this function uses failure to avoid rebuilding
unchanged subterms. That is to say, during execution the exception
`QConv.UNCHANGED` may be generated and later trapped. The behaviour of
the function is dependent on this use of failure. So, if the
conversion given as an argument happens to generate the same
exception, the operation of `DEPTH_CONV` will be unpredictable.
