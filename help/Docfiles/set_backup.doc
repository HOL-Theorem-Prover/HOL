\DOC set_backup

\TYPE {goalstackLib.set_backup : int -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Limits the number of proof states saved on the subgoal package backup list.

\DESCRIBE
The assignable variable {set_backup} is initially set to 12. Its value is one
less than the maximum number of proof states that may be saved on the backup
list. Adding a new proof state (by, for example, a call to {expand}) after the
maximum is reached causes the earliest proof state on the list to be discarded.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_goal}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#set_backup 0;
()  unit

#g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
"(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

() : void

#e CONJ_TAC;;
OK..
2 subgoals
"TL[1;2;3] = [2;3]"

"HD[1;2;3] = 1"

() : void

#e (REWRITE_TAC[HD]);;
