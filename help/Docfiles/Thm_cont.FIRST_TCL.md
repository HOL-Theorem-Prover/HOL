## `FIRST_TCL` {#Thm_cont.FIRST_TCL}


```
FIRST_TCL : (thm_tactical list -> thm_tactical)
```



Applies the first theorem-tactical in a list which succeeds.


When applied to a list of theorem-tacticals, a theorem-tactic and a theorem,
`FIRST_TCL` returns the tactic resulting from the application of the first
theorem-tactical to the theorem-tactic and theorem which succeeds. The effect
is the same as:
    
       FIRST_TCL [ttl1;...;ttln] = ttl1 ORELSE_TCL ... ORELSE_TCL ttln
    



### Failure

`FIRST_TCL` fails iff each tactic in the list fails when applied to the
theorem-tactic and theorem. This is trivially the case if the list is empty.
