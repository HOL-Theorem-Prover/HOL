\DOC HALF_MK_PABS

\TYPE {HALF_MK_PABS : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, definition.

\LIBRARY
pair

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a function definition to lambda-form.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t1 p = t2}, whose conclusion is a
universally quantified equation, {HALF_MK_PABS} returns the theorem
{A |- t1 = (\p. t2)}.
{
    A |- !p. t1 p = t2
   --------------------  HALF_MK_PABS            [where p is not free in t1]
    A |- t1 = (\p. t2)
}


\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a singly paired universally quantified equation
whose left-hand side is a function applied to the quantified pair,
or if any of the variables in the quantified pair is free in that function.
