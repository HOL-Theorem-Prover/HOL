\TYPE {cv_trans_pre : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Translates functional definitions to the {cv_compute} subset of HOL.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
Accepts a theorem describing a functional definition.  Attempts to translate
this to a function operating over the {:cv} type, used by
{cv_computeLib.cv_compute}.  Returns a precondition representing the proof
obligation which must be discharged before this translated function can be
evaluated with {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.

\FAILURE
When the translation does not produce a precondition, or encounters a sub-term
containing a constant that has not already been translated, or
{cv_transLib.cv_termination_tac} fails to prove the termination goal of the
translator-defined {:cv} function.

\EXAMPLE

{
> cv_trans_pre listTheory.HD;
Finished translating HD, stored in cv_HD_thm

WARNING: definition of cv_HD has a precondition.
You can set up the precondition proof as follows:

Theorem HD_pre[cv_pre]:
  ∀v. HD_pre v
Proof
  ho_match_mp_tac HD_ind (* for example *)
  ...
QED

val it = ⊢ ∀v. HD_pre v ⇔ (∃t h. v = h::t) ∧ v ≠ []: thm
}

\COMMENTS
Designed to produce definitions suitable for evaluation by {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.
