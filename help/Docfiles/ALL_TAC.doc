\DOC ALL_TAC

\TYPE {ALL_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Passes on a goal unchanged.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, identity.

\DESCRIBE
{ALL_TAC} applied to a goal {g} simply produces the subgoal list {[g]}. It is
the identity for the {THEN} tactical.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The tactic {INDUCT_TAC THENL [ALL_TAC;tac]}, applied to a goal {g}, applies
{INDUCT_TAC} to {g} to give a basis and step subgoal; it then returns the
basis unchanged, along with the subgoals produced by applying {tac} to the
step.

\USES 
Used to write tacticals such as {REPEAT}. Also, it is often used
as a place-holder in building compound tactics using tacticals such as
{THENL}.
