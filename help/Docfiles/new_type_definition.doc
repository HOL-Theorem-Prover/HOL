\TYPE {new_type_definition : {{name :string, pred :term, inhab_thm}} -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Defines a new type constant or type operator.

\DESCRIBE
The ML function {new_type_definition} implements the primitive HOL rule of
definition for introducing new type constants or type operators into the logic.
If {"t"} is a term of type {ty->bool} containing {n} distinct type variables,
then evaluating:
{
   new_type_definition{{name = "op", pred = "t", inhab_thm = |- ?x. t x}}
}
\noindent results in {op} being declared as a new {n}-ary type operator in the
current theory and returned by the call to {new_type_definition}. This new type
operator is characterized by a definitional axiom of the form:
{
   |- ?rep:('a,...,'n)op->ty. TYPE_DEFINITION t rep
}
\noindent which is stored as a definition in the current theory segment
under the automatically-generated name {`op_TY_DEF`}. The constant
{TYPE_DEFINITION} in this axiomatic characterization of {op} is defined by:
{
   |- TYPE_DEFINITION (P:'a->bool) (rep:'b->'a) =
         (!x' x''. (rep x' = rep x'') ==> (x' = x'')) /\
         (!x. P x = (?x'. x = rep x'))
}
\noindent Thus {|- ?rep. TYPE_DEFINITION P rep} asserts that there is a
bijection between the newly defined type {('a,...,'n)op} and the set of values
of type {ty} that satisfy {P}.

\FAILURE
Executing {new_type_definition{{name="op",pred="t",inhab_thm=th}}} fails if 
{op} is already the name of a type or type operator in the current theory, if
{"t"} does not have a type of the form {ty->bool} or {th} is not an 
assumption-free theorem of the form {|- ?x. t x}, if there already exists a
constant definition, constant specification, type definition or axiom named
{op_TY_DEF} in the current theory segment, or if HOL is not in draft mode.
