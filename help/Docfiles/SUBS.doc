\DOC SUBS

\TYPE {SUBS : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes simple term substitutions in a theorem using a given list of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
Term substitution in HOL is performed by replacing free subterms according to
the transformations specified by a list of equational theorems.  Given a list
of theorems {A1|-t1=v1,...,An|-tn=vn} and a theorem {A|-t}, {SUBS}
simultaneously replaces each free occurrence of {ti} in {t} with {vi}:
{
          A1|-t1=v1 ... An|-tn=vn    A|-t
   ---------------------------------------------  SUBS[A1|-t1=v1;...;An|-tn=vn]
    A1 u ... u An u A |- t[v1,...,vn/t1,...,tn]       (A|-t)
}
\noindent No matching is involved; the occurrence of each {ti} being
substituted for must be a free in {t} (see {SUBST_MATCH}).  An occurrence which
is not free can be substituted by using rewriting rules such as {REWRITE_RULE},
{PURE_REWRITE_RULE} and {ONCE_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
{SUBS [th1;...;thn] (A|-t)} fails if the conclusion of each theorem in the list
is not an equation.  No change is made to the theorem {A |- t} if no occurrence
of any left-hand side of the supplied equations appears in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
Substitutions are made with the theorems
{
   #let thm1 = SPECL ["m:num"; "n:num"] ADD_SYM
   #and thm2 = CONJUNCT1 ADD_CLAUSES;;
   thm1 = |- m + n = n + m
   thm2 = |- 0 + m = m
}
\noindent depending on the occurrence of free subterms
{
   #SUBS [thm1; thm2] (ASSUME "(n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n");;
   . |- (n + 0) + m = n + m

   #SUBS [thm1; thm2] (ASSUME "!n. (n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n");;
   . |- !n. (n + 0) + m = m + n
}
\USES
{SUBS} can sometimes be used when rewriting (for example, with {REWRITE_RULE})
would diverge and term instantiation is not needed.  Moreover, applying the
substitution rules is often much faster than using the rewriting rules.
