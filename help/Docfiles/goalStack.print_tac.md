## `print_tac` {#goalStack.print_tac}


```
print_tac : string -> tactic
```



Prints the goal; does not change it.


The tactic `print_tac s` prints the string `s` followed by (the
pretty-printed string of) the goal to which it is applied (using the
standard SML `print` function).  The effect on the goal is as if the
tactic `ALL_TAC` had been applied (i.e., the state of the goal is not
changed).

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

This is useful for debugging tactic applications in contexts where the usual interactive goal-stack is not available.
