\TYPE {Compat.PROVE : (term * tactic) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic.

\KEYWORDS
apply.

\DESCRIBE

Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a term-tactic pair
{(tm,tac)}, the function {PROVE} attempts to prove the goal {?- tm},
that is, the term {tm} with no assumptions, using the tactic {tac}. If
{PROVE} succeeds, it returns the corresponding theorem {A |- tm}, where
the assumption list {A} may not be empty if the tactic is invalid;
{PROVE} has no inbuilt validity-checking.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be the
conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal. Also
fails if the hol88 library has not been loaded.

\COMMENTS
In hol90, use {prove} instead; in hol90 {PROVE} has been replaced by {prove} 
and {prove_thm} has been replaced by {store_thm}.
