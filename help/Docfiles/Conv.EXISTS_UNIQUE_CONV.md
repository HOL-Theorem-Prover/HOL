## `EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV` {#Conv.EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV}


```
EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV : conv
```



Expands with the definition of unique existence.


Given a term of the form `"?!x.P[x]"`, the conversion `EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV`
proves that this assertion is equivalent to the conjunction of two statements,
namely that there exists at least one value `x` such that `P[x]`, and that
there is at most one value `x` for which `P[x]` holds. The theorem returned is:
    
       |- (?! x. P[x]) = (?x. P[x]) /\ (!x x'. P[x] /\ P[x'] ==> (x = x'))
    
where `x'` is a primed variant of `x` that does not appear free in
the input term.  Note that the quantified variable `x` need not in fact appear
free in the body of the input term.  For example, `EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV "?!x.T"`
returns the theorem:
    
       |- (?! x. T) = (?x. T) /\ (!x x'. T /\ T ==> (x = x'))
    



### Failure

`EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV tm` fails if `tm` does not have the form `"?!x.P"`.
