## `eall` {#proofManagerLib.eall}


```
eall : tactic -> proof
```



Applies a tactic to all goals in the current goal list,
replacing the list with the resulting subgoals.


`eall tac` applies `tac` to all the goals in the current goal list,
replacing the goal list with the list of all the resulting subgoals.
It is an abbreviation for `expand_list (ALLGOALS tac)`.


For interactively constructing suitable compound tactics:
in an interactive proof, the effect of `e (tac1 THEN tac2)`
can be obtained by `e tac1` and then `eall tac2`.
