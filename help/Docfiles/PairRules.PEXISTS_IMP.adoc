PEXISTS_IMP : (term -> thm -> thm)

KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential, implication.

LIBRARY
pair

SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies both the antecedent and consequent of an implication.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a
theorem {A |- t1 ==> t2}, the inference rule {PEXISTS_IMP} returns the
theorem {A |- (?p. t1) ==> (?p. t2)},
provided no variable in {p} is free in the assumptions.

         A |- t1 ==> t2
   --------------------------  EXISTS_IMP "x"   [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (?x.t1) ==> (?x.t2)




FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not implicative, or if the term is not a paired
structure of variables, of if any variable in the pair is free in the
assumption list.
