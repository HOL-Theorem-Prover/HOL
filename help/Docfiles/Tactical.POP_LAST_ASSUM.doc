\TYPE {POP_LAST_ASSUM : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies tactic generated from the last element of a goal's assumption list.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactic and a goal, {POP_LAST_ASSUM} applies
the theorem-tactic to the {ASSUME}d last element of the assumption
list, and applies the resulting tactic to the goal without that
assumption in its assumption list:
{
   POP_LAST_ASSUM f ({A1,...,Am,An} ?- t) = f (An |- An) ({A1,...,Am} ?- t)
}


\FAILURE
Fails if the assumption list of the goal is empty, or the theorem-tactic
fails when applied to the popped assumption, or if the resulting tactic
fails when applied to the goal (with depleted assumption list).

\COMMENTS
The tactical {POP_LAST_ASSUM} is also available under the lower-case
version of the name, {pop_last_assum}.
