## `UNABBREV_TAC` {#Q.UNABBREV_TAC}


```
Q.UNABBREV_TAC : term quotation -> tactic
```



Removes an abbreviation from a goal’s assumptions by substituting it
out.


The argument to `UNABBREV_TAC` must be a quotation containing the name
of a variable that is abbreviated in the current goal.  In other
words, when calling `` UNABBREV_TAC `v` ``, there must be an assumption of
the form `Abbrev(v = e)` in the goal’s assumptions.  This assumption
is removed, and all occurrences of the variable `v` in the goal are
replaced by `e`.   If there are two abbreviation assumptions for `v`
in the goal, the more recent is removed.

### Example

The goal
    
       Abbrev(v = 2 * x + 1), v + x < 10 ?- P(v)
    
is transformed by `` Q.UNABBREV_TAC `v` `` to
    
       2 * x + 1 + x < 10 ?- P(2 * x + 1)
    

### Failure

Fails if there is no abbreviation of the required form in the goal’s
assumptions, or if the quotation doesn’t parse to a variable.
