## `SET_SPEC_CONV` {#pred_setLib.SET_SPEC_CONV}


```
SET_SPEC_CONV : conv
```



Axiom-scheme of specification for set abstractions.


The conversion `SET_SPEC_CONV` expects its term argument to be an assertion of
the form `t IN {E | P}`. Given such a term, the conversion returns a
theorem that defines the condition under which this membership assertion holds.
When `E` is just a variable `v`, the conversion returns:
    
       |- t IN {v | P} = P[t/v]
    
and when `E` is not a variable but some other expression, the theorem
returned is:
    
       |- t IN {E | P} = ?x1...xn. (t = E) /\ P
    
where `x1`, ..., `xn` are the variables that occur free both in
the expression `E` and in the proposition `P`.

### Example

    
    - SET_SPEC_CONV ``12 IN {n | n > N}``;
    |- 12 IN {n | n > N} = 12 > N
    
    - SET_SPEC_CONV ``p IN {(n,m) | n < m}``;
    |- p IN {(n,m) | n < m} = (?n m. (p = n,m) /\ n < m)
    

### Failure

Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form  `t IN {E | P}`.
