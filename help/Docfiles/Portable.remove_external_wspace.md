```



Removes trailing and leading whitespace characters from a string


A call to `remove_external_wspace s` returns a string identical to `s`
except that all leading and trailing characters for which
`Char.isSpace` is true have been removed. The implementation is (with
the Basisâ€™s `Substring` structure open):
    
       string (dropl Char.isSpace (dropr Char.isSpace (full s)))
    

### Failure

Never fails.
