\TYPE {cv_trans : thm -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Translates functional definitions to the {cv_compute} subset of HOL.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
This function is the same as {cv_transLib.cv_trans_pre}, except that it
tries to discharge any preconditions automatically.

\FAILURE
When translation produces a precondition that {cv_transLib.cv_trans} cannot
prove automatically, or encounters a sub-term containing a constant that has
not already been translated, or {cv_transLib.cv_termination_tac} fails to prove
the termination goal of the translator-defined {:cv} function. In the latter
case, the termination goal is pushed onto the goal stack.
