## `X_FUN_EQ_CONV` {#Conv.X_FUN_EQ_CONV}


```
X_FUN_EQ_CONV : (term -> conv)
```



Performs extensionality conversion for functions (function equality).


The conversion `X_FUN_EQ_CONV` embodies the fact that two functions are equal
precisely when they give the same results for all values to which they can be
applied. For any variable `"x"` and equation `"f = g"`, where `x` is of type
`ty1` and `f` and `g` are functions of type `ty1->ty2`, a call to
`X_FUN_EQ_CONV "x" "f = g"` returns the theorem:
    
       |- (f = g) = (!x. f x = g x)
    



### Failure

`X_FUN_EQ_CONV x tm` fails if `x` is not a variable or if `tm` is not an
equation `f = g` where `f` and `g` are functions.  Furthermore, if `f` and `g`
are functions of type `ty1->ty2`, then the variable `x` must have type `ty1`;
otherwise the conversion fails.  Finally, failure also occurs if `x` is free in
either `f` or `g`.
