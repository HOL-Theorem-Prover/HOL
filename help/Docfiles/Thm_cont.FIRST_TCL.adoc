FIRST_TCL : (thm_tactical list -> thm_tactical)

SYNOPSIS
Applies the first theorem-tactical in a list which succeeds.

KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of theorem-tacticals, a theorem-tactic and a theorem,
{FIRST_TCL} returns the tactic resulting from the application of the first
theorem-tactical to the theorem-tactic and theorem which succeeds. The effect
is the same as:

   FIRST_TCL [ttl1;...;ttln] = ttl1 ORELSE_TCL ... ORELSE_TCL ttln




FAILURE
{FIRST_TCL} fails iff each tactic in the list fails when applied to the
theorem-tactic and theorem. This is trivially the case if the list is empty.

SEEALSO
Thm_cont.EVERY_TCL, Thm_cont.ORELSE_TCL, Thm_cont.REPEAT_TCL,
Thm_cont.THEN_TCL.
