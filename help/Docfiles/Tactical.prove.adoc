----------------------------------------------------------------------
prove : term * tactic -> thm

SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-tactic pair {(tm,tac)}, the function {prove} attempts to
prove the goal {?- tm}, that is, the term {tm} with no assumptions, using the
tactic {tac}. If {prove} succeeds, it returns the corresponding theorem
{A |- tm}, where the assumption list {A} may not be empty if the tactic is
invalid; {prove} has no inbuilt validity-checking.

FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.

SEEALSO
Tactical.TAC_PROOF.
