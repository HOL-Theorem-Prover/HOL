## `set_state` {#holCheckLib.set_state}


```
set_state :  term -> model -> model
```



Sets the state tuple used internally by the formal model contructed by HolCheck.

### Comments

This information is optional when constructing HolCheck models. By default, HolCheck will construct the state tuple itself. In practice however, a user nearly always needs to supply the state tuple, since it is almost always  required when specifying properties.
