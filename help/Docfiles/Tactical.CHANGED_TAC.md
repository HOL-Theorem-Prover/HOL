## `CHANGED_TAC` {#Tactical.CHANGED_TAC}


```
CHANGED_TAC : (tactic -> tactic)
```



Makes a tactic fail if it has no effect.


When applied to a tactic `T`, the tactical `CHANGED_TAC` gives a new tactic
which is the same as `T` if that has any effect, and otherwise fails.

### Failure

The application of `CHANGED_TAC` to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic fails if the basic tactic either fails or has no effect.
