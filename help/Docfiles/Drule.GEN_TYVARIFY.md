## `GEN_TYVARIFY` {#Drule.GEN_TYVARIFY}


```
GEN_TYVARIFY : thm -> thm
```



Replace a theorem’s type variables with fresh versions


A call to `GEN_TYVARIFY th` replaces (with `INST_TYPE`) the type
variables occurring in theorem `th`’s conclusion that do not also
appear in any of `th`’s hypotheses. The new type variables are
generated by successive calls to `gen_tyvar`, so should not have been
seen before.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

The derived rule `FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY` will instantiate all of a
theorem’s type variables, whether or not they appear in the
hypotheses.
