## `GEN_TYVARIFY`

``` hol4
Drule.GEN_TYVARIFY : thm -> thm
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replace a theorem's type variables with fresh versions

A call to `GEN_TYVARIFY th` replaces (with `INST_TYPE`) the type
variables occurring in theorem `th`'s conclusion that do not also appear
in any of `th`'s hypotheses. The new type variables are generated by
successive calls to `gen_tyvar`, so should not have been seen before.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Comments

The derived rule `FULL_GEN_TYVARIFY` will instantiate all of a theorem's
type variables, whether or not they appear in the hypotheses.
