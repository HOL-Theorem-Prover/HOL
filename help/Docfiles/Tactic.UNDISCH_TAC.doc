\DOC UNDISCH_TAC

\TYPE {UNDISCH_TAC : term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Undischarges an assumption and deletes all assumptions that are
alpha-equivalent to it.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, discharge.

\DESCRIBE
Let {a1} to {an} be the assumptions that are alpha-equivalent to {v}, then
{
               A ?- t
   ==============================  UNDISCH_TAC v
    A - {a1, ..., an} ?- v ==> t
}

In particular, if {v} is among the assumptions of the goal and no other
assumption is alpha-equivalent to it, then {UNDISCH_TAC} behaves as the
opposite of {DISCH_TAC}:
{
          A ?- t
   ====================  UNDISCH_TAC v
    A - {v} ?- v ==> t
}

\FAILURE
{UNDISCH_TAC} fails if no assumption is alpha-equivalent to {v}.

\COMMENTS
In the typical use {v} is among the assumptions. If only a single
assumption alpha-equivalent to {v}, but it is different from {v} then the
action of {UNDISCH_TAC} can be seen as undischarging followed by
alpha-conversion.
