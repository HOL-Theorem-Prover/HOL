axioms : string -> (string * thm) list

SYNOPSIS
All the axioms stored in the named theory.

DESCRIBE
An invocation {axioms thy}, where {thy} is the name of a currently
loaded theory segment, will return a list of the axioms stored in
that theory. Each theorem is paired with its name in the result.
The string {"-"} may be used to denote the current theory segment.

FAILURE
Never fails. If {thy} is not the name of a currently loaded theory segment,
the empty list is returned.

EXAMPLE

- axioms "bool";
> val it =
    [("INFINITY_AX", |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f),
     ("SELECT_AX", |- !P x. P x ==> P ($@ P)),
     ("ETA_AX", |- !t. (\x. t x) = t),
     ("BOOL_CASES_AX", |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F))] : (string * thm) list




SEEALSO
DB.thy, DB.fetch, DB.thms, DB.theorems, DB.definitions, DB.listDB.
