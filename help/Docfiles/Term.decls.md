## `decls` {#Term.decls}


```
decls : string -> term list
```



Returns a list of constants having the same name.


An invocation `Term.decls s` returns a list of constants found
in the current theory having the name `s`. If there are no constants
with name `s`, then the empty list is returned.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - decls "+";
    > val it = [`$+`] : term list
    
    - map dest_thy_const it;
    > val it = [{Name = "+", Thy = "arithmetic", Ty = `:num -> num -> num`}] : ...
    



### Comments

Useful for untangling confusion arising from overloading and
also the possibility to declare two different constants with the
same name in different theories.
