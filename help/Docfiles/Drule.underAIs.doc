\TYPE {underAIs : (thm -> thm) -> (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a derived rule underneath external “guarding” of universal
variables and implications.

\KEYWORDS
Derived rule

\DESCRIBE

A call to {underAIs f th} strips away external guarding in {th},
applies the function {f}, and then restores the original guarding. In
this context, “guarding” is the presence of universal quantifications
and antecedents in implications. Thus, this function sees the theorem
{∀x. p x ==> ∀y. q y ∧ r x y ==> s} as the body {s}, guarded by
the universal variables {x} and {y} and the assumptions {p x} and
{q y ∧ r x y}. Negations in the body are not viewed as implications.

\FAILURE
As all theorems are of this shape, the stripping and restoration of
guarding always succeeds. However, this function will fail if {f}
fails when applied to the theorem {A' |- s}, with {s} the body (as
above), and {A'} the original hypotheses of theorem augmented with the
antecendents of guarding implications.

\EXAMPLE
{
> underAIs (EXISTS (“∃m. (k * n) MOD m = 0”, “n:num”))
           arithmeticTheory.MOD_EQ_0;
val it = ⊢ ∀n. 0 < n ⇒ ∀k. ∃m. (k * n) MOD m = 0: thm
}
