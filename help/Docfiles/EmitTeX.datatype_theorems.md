## `datatype_theorems` {#EmitTeX.datatype_theorems}


```
datatype_theorems : string -> (string * thm) list
```



All the datatype theorems stored in the named theory.


An invocation `datatype_theorems thy`, where `thy` is the name of a currently
loaded theory segment, will return a list of the datatype theorems stored in
that theory. Each theorem is paired with the name of the datatype in the result. The string "-" may be used to denote the current theory segment.

### Failure

Never fails. If `thy` is not the name of a currently loaded theory segment,
the empty list is returned.

### Example

    
    - new_theory "example";
    <<HOL message: Created theory "example">>
    > val it = () : unit
    - val _ = Hol_datatype `example = First | Second`;
    <<HOL message: Defined type: "example">>
    - EmitTeX.datatype_theorems "example";
    > val it = [("example", |- DATATYPE (example First Second))] :
      (string * thm) list
