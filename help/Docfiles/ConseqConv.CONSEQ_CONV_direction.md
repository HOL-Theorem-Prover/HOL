## `CONSEQ_CONV_direction` {#ConseqConv.CONSEQ_CONV_direction}


```
type CONSEQ_CONV_direction
```



A type used to tell directed consequence conversions what the
desired result should look like.


This type is used to instruct a directed consequence conversion how to
behave. Given a direction `dir` and a boolean term `t` the result of
a directed consequence conversion `DCONSEQ_CONV` should be of the form
    
    - st ==> t for dir = CONSEQ_CONV_STRENGTHEN_direction
    - t ==> wt for dir = CONSEQ_CONV_WEAKEN_direction
    - st ==> t, t ==> wt or t = eqt for dir = CONSEQ_CONV_UNKNOWN_direction
