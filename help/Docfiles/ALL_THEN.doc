\DOC ALL_THEN

\TYPE {ALL_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Passes a theorem unchanged to a theorem-tactic.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, identity.

\DESCRIBE
For any theorem-tactic {ttac} and theorem {th}, the application {ALL_THEN ttac
th} results simply in {ttac th}, that is, the theorem is passed unchanged to
the theorem-tactic. {ALL_THEN} is the identity theorem-tactical.

\FAILURE
The application of {ALL_THEN} to a theorem-tactic never fails. The resulting
theorem-tactic fails under exactly the same conditions as the original one.

\USES
Writing compound tactics or tacticals, e.g. terminating list iterations
of theorem-tacticals.
