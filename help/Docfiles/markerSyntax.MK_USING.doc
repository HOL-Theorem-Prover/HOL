\TYPE {MK_USING : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Encodes a theorem so it can be {ASSUME_TAC}-ed into a goal.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {MK_USING th} encodes {th} in such a way that it can safely
be the argument to {ASSUME_TAC}, and detectable by other tactics
operating on the resulting goal as a theorem that might be worthy of
notice.

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem has no hypotheses, is polymorphic, and
cannot be found by reverse lookup in the theorem database (using
{DB.revlookup}).
