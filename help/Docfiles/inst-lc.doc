\TYPE {inst : hol_type subst -> term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs type instantiations in a term. NOT the same as the hol88 inst; the
first argument (the "away-from" list) used in hol88 {inst} is unnecessary and
hence dispensed with, PLUS hol90 insists that all redexes be type variables.

\DESCRIBE
The function {inst} should be used as follows:
{
   inst [{{redex_1, residue_1}},...,{{redex_n, residue_n}}] tm
}
\noindent where the redexes are all {hol_type} variables, and the residues
all {hol_types} and {tm} a term to be type-instantiated. This call will
replace each occurrence of a {redex} in {tm} by its associated
{residue}. Replacement is done in parallel, i.e., once a {redex} has been
replaced by its {residue}, at some place in the term, that {residue} at that
place will not itself be replaced in the current call. Bound term
variables may be renamed in order to preserve the term structure.

\FAILURE
Fails if there exists a redex in the substition that is not a type variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
- show_types := true;
> val it = () : unit

- let val tm = --`(x:'a) = (x:'a)`--
  in inst [{{redex = ==`:'a`==, residue = ==`:num`==}}] tm
  end;
> val it = (--`(x :num) = (x :num)`--) : term

- inst [{{redex = ==`:bool`==, residue = ==`:num`==}}] (--`x:bool`--)
  handle e => Raise e;
Exception raised at Term.inst:
redex in type substitution not a variable

- let val x = --`x:bool`--
  in inst [{{redex = ==`:'a`==, residue = ==`:bool`==}}]
          (--`\x:'a. ^x`--)
  end;
(--`\(x' :bool). (x :bool)`--) : term

}
\USES
Performing internal functions connected with type instantiation.
