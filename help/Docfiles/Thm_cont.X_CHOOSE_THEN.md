## `X_CHOOSE_THEN` {#Thm_cont.X_CHOOSE_THEN}


```
X_CHOOSE_THEN : (term -> thm_tactical)
```



Replaces existentially quantified variable with given witness, and passes it to
a theorem-tactic.


`X_CHOOSE_THEN` expects a variable `y`, a tactic-generating function
`f:thm->tactic`, and a theorem of the form `(A1 |- ?x. w)` as
arguments.  A new theorem is created by introducing the given variable
`y` as a witness for the object `x` whose existence is asserted in the original
theorem, `(w[y/x] |- w[y/x])`.  If the tactic-generating function `f`
applied to this theorem produces results as follows when applied to a
goal `(A ?- t)`:
    
        A ?- t
       =========  f ({w[y/x]} |- w[y/x])
        A ?- t1
    
then applying `(X_CHOOSE_THEN "y" f (A1 |- ?x. w))` to the
goal `(A ?- t)` produces the subgoal:
    
        A ?- t
       =========  X_CHOOSE_THEN y f (A1 |- ?x. w)
        A ?- t1         (y not free anywhere)
    



### Failure

Fails if the theoremâ€™s conclusion is not existentially quantified, or
if the first argument is not a variable. Failures may arise in the
tactic-generating function. An invalid tactic is produced if the
introduced variable is free in `w`, `t` or `A`, or if the theorem has
any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an assumption of the
goal.

### Example

Given a goal of the form
    
       {n < m} ?- ?x. m = n + (x + 1)
    
the following theorem may be applied:
    
       th = [n < m] |- ?p. m = n + p
    
by the tactic `` (X_CHOOSE_THEN (Term`q:num`) SUBST1_TAC th) `` giving
the subgoal:
    
       {n < m} ?- ?x. n + q = n + (x + 1)
