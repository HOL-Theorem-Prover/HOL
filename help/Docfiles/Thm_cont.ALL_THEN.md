## `ALL_THEN`

``` hol4
Thm_cont.ALL_THEN : thm_tactical
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passes a theorem unchanged to a theorem-tactic.

For any theorem-tactic `ttac` and theorem `th`, the application
`ALL_THEN ttac th` results simply in `ttac th`, that is, the theorem is
passed unchanged to the theorem-tactic. `ALL_THEN` is the identity
theorem-tactical.

### Failure

The application of `ALL_THEN` to a theorem-tactic never fails. The
resulting theorem-tactic fails under exactly the same conditions as the
original one.

Writing compound tactics or tacticals, e.g.Â terminating list iterations
of theorem-tacticals.
