## `CONJUNCTS_AC` {#Drule.CONJUNCTS_AC}


```
CONJUNCTS_AC : term * term -> thm
```



Prove equivalence under idempotence, symmetry and associativity of conjunction.


`CONJUNCTS_AC` takes a pair of terms `(t1, t2)` and proves
`|- t1 = t2` if `t1` and `t2` are equivalent up to idempotence, symmetry and
associativity of conjunction.  That is, if `t1` and `t2` are two (different)
arbitrarily-nested conjunctions of the same set of terms, then
`CONJUNCTS_AC (t1,t2)` returns `|- t1 = t2`. Otherwise, it fails.

### Failure

Fails if `t1` and `t2` are not equivalent, as described above.

### Example

    
    - CONJUNCTS_AC (Term `(P /\ Q) /\ R`, Term `R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P`);
    > val it = |- (P /\ Q) /\ R = R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P : thm
    


Used to reorder a conjunction.  First sort the conjuncts in a term
`t1` into the desired order (e.g., lexicographic order, for
normalization) to get a new term `t2`, then call
`CONJUNCTS_AC(t1,t2)`.
