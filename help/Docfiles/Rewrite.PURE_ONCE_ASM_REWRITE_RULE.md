## `PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE` {#Rewrite.PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE}


```
PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)
```



Rewrites a theorem once, including the theoremâ€™s assumptions as rewrites.


`PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE` excludes the basic tautologies in
`implicit_rewrites` from the theorems used for rewriting. It searches for
matching subterms once only, without recursing over already rewritten
subterms. For a general introduction to rewriting tools see
`GEN_REWRITE_RULE`.

### Failure
