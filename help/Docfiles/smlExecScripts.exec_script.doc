\DOC exec_script

\TYPE {exec_script : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Execute the script given in the file {f}.

\DESCRIBE
The script is executed only for its side effects.
The execution standard out is redirected to 
{src/AI/sml_inspection/buildheap/buildheap_yourscript} where yourscript is
the basename of {f} without extension. This file is worth expecting to debug 
uncaught errors.

\FAILURE
Never fails.


\EXAMPLE
{
- load "aiLib"; open aiLib;
- load "smlExecScripts"; open smlExecScripts;
(* output omitted *)
> val it = () : unit

val dir = HOLDIR ^ "/src/AI/sml_inspection"; (* user can choose *)
val scriptin = dir ^ "/script.sml";
val scriptout = dir ^ "/script-out";
(* output omitted *)

- writel scriptin
  ["load \"aiLib\"; open aiLib;", 
   String.concatWith " " ["writel", mlquote scriptout, "[\"hello world!\"]"]];
> val it = (): unit

- exec_script scriptin;
> val it = (): unit

- readl "script-out";
> val it = ["hello world!"]: string list
}

\COMMENTS
An Holmakefile might be placed in the same directory as the script to help
{exec_script} ({heapname},{genscriptdep}) figure out the dependencies of the 
script. For example, a Holmakefile might include the line {INCLUDES = path-to-
your-dependency}.
