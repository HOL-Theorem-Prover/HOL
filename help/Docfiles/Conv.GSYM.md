## `GSYM` {#Conv.GSYM}


```
GSYM : thm -> thm
```



Reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a top-down search.


The inference rule `GSYM` reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a
top-down search of the conclusion of the argument theorem. An equation will be
reversed iff it is not a proper subterm of another equation. If a theorem
contains no equations, it will be returned unchanged.

### Failure

Never fails, and never loops infinitely.

### Example

    
    - arithmeticTheory.ADD;
    > val it = |- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n)) : thm
    
    - GSYM arithmeticTheory.ADD;
    > val it = |- (!n. n = 0 + n) /\ (!m n. SUC(m + n) = (SUC m) + n) : thm
