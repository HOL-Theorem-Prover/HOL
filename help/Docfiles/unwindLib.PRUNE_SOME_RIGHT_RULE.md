## `PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE` {#unwindLib.PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE}


```
PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE : (string list -> thm -> thm)
```



Prunes several hidden variables.


`` PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE [`li1`;...;`lik`] `` behaves as follows:
    
        A |- !z1 ... zr.
              t = ?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqni1 /\ ... /\ eqnik /\ ... /\ tp
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
               A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?li(k+1) ... lir. t1 /\ ... /\ tp
    
where for `1 <= j <= k`, each `eqnij` has the form:
    
       "!y1 ... ym. lij x1 ... xn = b"
    
and `lij` does not appear free in any of the other conjuncts or in
`b`. The `li`’s are related by the equation:
    
       {{li1,...,lik}} u {{li(k+1),...,lir}} = {{l1,...,lr}}
    
The rule works if one or more of the `eqnij`’s are not present, that
is if `lij` is not free in any of the conjuncts, but does not work if `lij`
appears free in more than one of the conjuncts. `p` may be zero, that is, all
the conjuncts may be `eqnij`’s. In this case the conjunction will be
transformed to `T` (true). Also, for each `eqnij`, `m` and `n` may be zero.

If there is more than one line with a specified name (but with different
types), the one that appears outermost in the existential quantifications is
pruned. If such a line name is mentioned twice in the list, the two outermost
occurrences of lines with that name will be pruned, and so on.

### Failure

Fails if the argument theorem is not of the specified form or if any of the
`lij`’s are free in more than one of the conjuncts or if the equation for any
`lij` is recursive. The function also fails if any of the specified lines are
not one of the existentially quantified lines.

### Example

    
    #PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE [`l1`;`l2`]
    # (ASSUME
    #   "!(in:num->bool) (out:num->bool).
    #     DEV (in,out) =
    #      ?(l1:num->bool) l2.
    #       (!x. l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~(in x)) /\ (!x. out x = ~(in x))");;
    . |- !in out. DEV(in,out) = (!x. out x = ~in x)
