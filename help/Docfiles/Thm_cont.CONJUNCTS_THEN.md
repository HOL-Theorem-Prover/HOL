## `CONJUNCTS_THEN` {#Thm_cont.CONJUNCTS_THEN}


```
CONJUNCTS_THEN : thm_tactical
```



Applies a theorem-tactic to each conjunct of a theorem.


`CONJUNCTS_THEN` takes a theorem-tactic `f`, and a theorem `t` whose conclusion
must be a conjunction. `CONJUNCTS_THEN` breaks `t` into two new theorems, `t1`
and `t2` which are `CONJUNCT1` and `CONJUNCT2` of `t` respectively, and then
returns a new tactic: `f t1 THEN f t2`. That is,
    
       CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- l /\ r) =  f (A |- l) THEN f (A |- r)
    
so if
    
       A1 ?- t1                    A2 ?- t2
      ==========  f (A |- l)      ==========  f (A |- r)
       A2 ?- t2                    A3 ?- t3
    
then
    
        A1 ?- t1
       ==========  CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- l /\ r)
        A3 ?- t3
    



### Failure

`CONJUNCTS_THEN f` will fail if applied to a theorem whose conclusion is not a
conjunction.

### Comments

`CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- u1 /\ ... /\ un)` results in the tactic:
    
       f (A |- u1) THEN f (A |- u2 /\ ... /\ un)
    
Unfortunately, it is more likely that the user had wanted the tactic:
    
       f (A |- u1) THEN ... THEN f(A |- un)
    
Such a tactic could be defined as follows:
    
       fun CONJUNCTS_THENL (f:thm_tactic) thm =
         List.foldl (op THEN) ALL_TAC (map f (CONJUNCTS thm));
    
or by using `REPEAT_TCL`.
