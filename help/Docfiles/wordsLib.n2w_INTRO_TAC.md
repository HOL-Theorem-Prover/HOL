## `n2w_INTRO_TAC` {#wordsLib.n2w_INTRO_TAC}


```
n2w_INTRO_TAC : int -> tactic
```



The tactic `n2w_INTRO_TAC i` attempts to recast finite problems (over `num`) of the form `m = n`, `m < n` and `m <= n` into problems over bit-vectors of size `i`.

### Example

Given the goal:
    
    ?- w2n (a: word4) + w2n (b: word4) < 32
    
applying
    
    e (wordsLib.n2w_INTRO_TAC 6)
    
gives the new goal
    
    [ w2n a < 16, w2n b < 16 ] ?- w2w a + w2w b <+ 32w
    
This goal can be solved using `blastLib.BBLAST_TAC`. Any word length strictly greater than five would have sufficed here; it is generally best to pick as small a word size as is necessary.
