\TYPE {WF_REL_TAC : term quotation -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Start termination proof.

\KEYWORDS
recursive definition, termination.

\DESCRIBE
{WF_REL_TAC} builds a tactic that starts a termination proof. An
invocation {WF_REL_TAC q}, where {q} should parse into a term that
denotes a well-founded relation, builds a tactic {tac} that is intended
to be applied to a goal arising from an application of {tgoal} or
{tprove}. Such a goal has the form
{
   ?R. WF R /\ ...
}
The tactic {tac} will instantiate {R} with the relation
denoted by {q} and will attempt various simplifications of the
goal. For example, it will try to automatically prove the
well-foundedness of the relation denoted by {q}, and will also attempt
to simplify the goal using some basic facts about well-founded
relations. Often this can result in a much simpler goal.

\FAILURE
{WF_REL_TAC q} fails if {q} does not parse into a term whose type is
an instance of {'a -> 'a -> bool}.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose that a version of Quicksort had been defined as follows:
{
   val qsort_defn =
        Hol_defn "qsort"
           `(qsort ___ [] = []) /\
            (qsort ord (x::rst) =
                APPEND (qsort ord (FILTER ($~ o ord x) rst))
                  (x :: qsort ord (FILTER (ord x) rst)))`;
}
Then one can start a termination proof as follows: set up a
goalstack with {tgoal} and then apply {WF_REL_TAC} with a quotation
denoting a suitable well-founded relation.
{
   - tgoal qsort_defn;
   > val it =
       Proof manager status: 1 proof.
       1. Incomplete:
          Initial goal:
           ?R. WF R /\
            (!rst x ord. R (ord,FILTER ($~ o ord x) rst) (ord,x::rst)) /\
             !rst x ord. R (ord,FILTER (ord x) rst) (ord,x::rst)

   - e (WF_REL_TAC `measure (LENGTH o SND)`);

   OK..
   2 subgoals:
   > val it =
      !rst x ord. LENGTH (FILTER (ord x) rst) < LENGTH (x::rst)

      !rst x ord. LENGTH (FILTER (\x'. ~ord x x') rst) < LENGTH (x::rst)
}
Execution of {WF_REL_TAC} has automatically proved the
well-foundedness of
{
   measure (LENGTH o SND)
}
and the remainder of the goal has been simplified into a
pair of easy goals.

\COMMENTS
There are two problems to deal with when trying to prove termination.
First, one has to understand, intuitively and then mathematically,
why the function under consideration terminates. Second, one must
be able to phrase this in HOL. In the following, we shall give a few
examples of how this is done.

There are a number of basic and advanced means of specifying well-founded
relations. The most common starting point for dealing with termination
problems for recursive functions is to find some function, known as a
'measure' under which the arguments of a function call are larger than
the arguments to any recursive calls that result.

For a very simple starter example, consider the following definition
of a function that computes the greatest common divisor of two
numbers:
{
   - val gcd_defn = Hol_defn "gcd"
        `(gcd (0,n) = n) /\
         (gcd (m,n) = gcd (n MOD m, m))`;

   - Defn.tgoal gcd_defn;

   > val it =
       Proof manager status: 1 proof.
       1. Incomplete:
            Initial goal:
            ?R. WF R /\ !v2 n. R (n MOD SUC v2,SUC v2) (SUC v2,n)
}
The recursion happens in the first argument, and the recursive call in
that position is a smaller number.  The way to phrase the termination of
{gcd} in HOL is to use a `measure` function to map from the domain of
{gcd}---a pair of numbers---to a number.  The definition of {measure}
is equivalent to
{
   measure f x y = (f x < f y).
}
(The actual definition of {measure} in {prim_recTheory} is more
primitive.)  Now we must pick out the argument position to measure and
invoke {WF_REL_TAC}:
{
   - e (WF_REL_TAC `measure FST`);
   OK..

   1 subgoal:
   > val it =
    !v2 n. n MOD SUC v2 < SUC v2
}
This goal is easy to prove with a few simple arithmetic facts:
{
   - e (PROVE_TAC [arithmeticTheory.DIVISION, prim_recTheory.LESS_0]);
   OK..

   Goal proved. ...
}
Sometimes one needs a measure function that is itself recursive.  For
example, consider a type of binary trees and a function that
`unbalances` trees. The algorithm works by rotating the tree until it
gets a {Leaf} in the left branch, then it recurses into the right
branch. At the end of execution the tree has been linearized.
{
   - Hol_datatype
      `btree = Leaf
             | Brh of btree => btree`;

   - val Unbal_defn =
      Hol_defn "Unbal"
      `(Unbal Leaf = Leaf)
   /\  (Unbal (Brh Leaf bt) = Brh Leaf (Unbal bt))
   /\  (Unbal (Brh (Brh bt1 bt2) bt) = Unbal (Brh bt1 (Brh bt2 bt)))`;

   - Defn.tgoal Unbal_defn;

   > val it =
       Proof manager status: 1 proof.
       1. Incomplete:
          Initial goal:
           ?R. WF R /\
               (!bt. R bt (Brh Leaf bt)) /\
               !bt bt2 bt1. R (Brh bt1 (Brh bt2 bt)) (Brh (Brh bt1 bt2) bt)
}
Since the size of the tree is unchanged in the last clause in the
definition of {Unbal}, a simple size measure will not work. Instead, we
can assign weights to nodes in the tree such that the recursive calls of
{Unbal} decrease the total weight in every case. One such assignment is
{
   Weight (Leaf) = 0
   Weight (Brh x y) = (2 * Weight x) + (Weight y) + 1
}
It is easiest to use {Define} to define {Weight}, but if one is
worried about "polluting" the signature, one can also use
{prove_rec_fn_exists} from the {Prim_rec} structure:
{
   val Weight =
     Prim_rec.prove_rec_fn_exists (TypeBase.axiom_of ("", "btree"))
      (Term`(Weight (Leaf) = 0) /\
            (Weight (Brh x y) = (2 * Weight x) + (Weight y) + 1)`);

   > val Weight =
      |- ?Weight.
            (Weight Leaf = 0) /\
            !x y. Weight (Brh x y) = 2 * Weight x + Weight y + 1 : thm

   - e (STRIP_ASSUME_TAC Weight);
   OK..

   1 subgoal:
   > val it =
       ?R.
         WF R /\ (!bt. R bt (Brh Leaf bt)) /\
         !bt bt2 bt1. R (Brh bt1 (Brh bt2 bt)) (Brh (Brh bt1 bt2) bt)
       ------------------------------------
         0.  Weight Leaf = 0
         1.  !x y. Weight (Brh x y) = 2 * Weight x + Weight y + 1
}
Now we can invoke {WF_REL_TAC}:
{
   e (WF_REL_TAC `measure Weight`);
   OK..

   2 subgoals:
   > val it =
    !bt bt2 bt1.
      Weight (Brh bt1 (Brh bt2 bt)) < Weight (Brh (Brh bt1 bt2) bt)
    ------------------------------------
      0.  Weight Leaf = 0
      1.  !x y. Weight (Brh x y) = 2 * Weight x + Weight y + 1

    !bt. Weight bt < Weight (Brh Leaf bt)
    ------------------------------------
      0.  Weight Leaf = 0
      1.  !x y. Weight (Brh x y) = 2 * Weight x + Weight y + 1
}
Both of these subgoals are quite easy to prove.

The technique of `weighting` nodes in a tree in order to prove
termination also goes by the name of `polynomial interpretation`. It
must be admitted that finding the correct weighting for a termination
proof is more an art than a science. Typically, one makes a guess and
then tries the termination proof to see if it works.

Occasionally, there's a combination of factors that complicate the
termination argument. For example, the following specification
describes a naive pattern matching algorithm on strings (represented
as lists here). The function takes four arguments: the first is the
remainder of the pattern being matched. The second is the remainder of
the string being searched.  The third argument holds the original
pattern to be matched. The fourth argument is the string being
searched. If the pattern (first argument) becomes exhausted, then a
match has been found and the function returns {T}. Otherwise, if the
string being searched becomes exhausted, the function returns {F}.
{
   val match0_defn =
     Hol_defn "match0"
          `(match0 [] __ __ __ = T)
      /\   (match0 __ [] __ __ = F)
      /\   (match0 (p::pp) (s::ss) p0 rs =
             if p=s then match0 pp ss p0 rs else
             if NULL rs then F
                else match0 p0 (TL rs) p0 (TL rs))`;

   - val match = Define `match pat str = match0 pat str pat str`;
}
The remaining case is when there's more searching to do; the function
checks if the head of the pattern is the same as the head of the
string being searched. If yes, then we recursively search, using the
tail of the pattern and the tail of the string being searched. If no,
that means that we have failed to match the pattern, so we should move
one character ahead in the string being searched and try again. If the
string being searched is empty, however, then we return {F}. The
second and third arguments both represent the string being
searched. The second argument is a kind of `local` version of the
string being searched; we recurse into it as long as there are matches
with the pattern. However, if the search eventually fails, then the
fourth argument, which `remembers` where the search started from, is
used to restart the search.

So much for the behaviour of the function. Why does it terminate? There
are two recursive calls. The first call reduces the size of the first
and second arguments, and leaves the other arguments unchanged. The
second call can increase the size of the first and second arguments, but
reduces the size of the fourth.

This is a classic situation in which to use a lexicographic ordering:
some arguments to the function are reduced in some recursive calls, and
some others are reduced in other recursive calls.  Recall that {LEX} is
an infix operator, defined in {pairTheory} as follows:
{
   LEX R1 R2 = \(x,y) (p,q). R1 x p \/ ((x=p) /\ R2 y q)
}
In the second recursive call, the length of {rs} is reduced, and in
the first it stays the same. This motivates having the length of the
fourth argument be the first component of the lexicographic
combination, and the length of the second argument as the second
component.

What we need now is to formalize this. We want to map from the
four-tuple of arguments into a lexicographic combination of
relations. This is enabled by {inv_image} from {relationTheory}:
{
   inv_image R f = \x y. R (f x) (f y)
}
The actual relation maps from the four-tuple of arguments into a pair
of numbers {(m,n)}, where {m} is the length of the fourth argument, and
{n} is the length of the second argument. These lengths are then
compared lexicographically with respect to less-than ({<}).
{
   - Defn.tgoal match0_defn;

   - e (WF_REL_TAC `inv_image ($< LEX $<)
                     (\(w,x,y,z). (LENGTH z, LENGTH x))`);

   OK..
   2 subgoals:
   > val it =
    !rs ss s p.
      (p=s) ==> LENGTH rs < LENGTH rs \/ LENGTH ss < LENGTH (s::ss)


    !ss rs s p.
      ~(p = s) /\ ~NULL rs ==>
      LENGTH (TL rs) < LENGTH rs \/
      (LENGTH (TL rs) = LENGTH rs) /\ LENGTH (TL rs) < LENGTH (s::ss)
}
The first subgoal needs a case-split on {rs} before it is proved by
rewriting, and the seconds is also easy to prove by rewriting.

As a final example, one occasionally needs to recurse over
non-concrete data, such as finite sets or multisets. We can define a
`fold` function (of questionable utility) for finite sets as follows:
{
   load "pred_setTheory"; open pred_setTheory;

   val FOLD_SET_defn =
     Defn.Hol_defn "FOLD_SET"
     `FOLD_SET (s:'a->bool) (b:'b) =
        if FINITE s then
           if s={} then b
           else FOLD_SET (REST s) (f (CHOICE s) b)
        else ARB`;
}
Typically, such functions terminate because the cardinality of the set
(or multiset) is reduced in the recursive call, and this is another
application of {measure}:
{
   val (FOLD_SET_0, FOLD_SET_IND) =
    Defn.tprove (FOLD_SET_defn,
      WF_REL_TAC `measure (CARD o FST)`
       THEN PROVE_TAC [CARD_PSUBSET, REST_PSUBSET]);

}
The desired recursion equation
{
   |- FINITE s ==> (FOLD_SET f s b =
                      if s = {} then b
                      else FOLD_SET f (REST s) (f (CHOICE s) b))
}
is easy to obtain from {FOLD_SET_0}.
