## `prove_rec_fn_exists`

``` hol4
Prim_rec.prove_rec_fn_exists : thm -> term -> thm
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proves the existence of a primitive recursive function over a concrete
recursive type.

`prove_rec_fn_exists` is a version of `new_recursive_definition` which
proves only that the required function exists; it does not make a
constant specification. The first argument is a primitive recursion
theorem of the form generated by `Hol_datatype`, and the second is a
user-supplied primitive recursive function definition. The theorem which
is returned asserts the existence of the recursively-defined function in
question (if it is primitive recursive over the type characterized by
the theorem given as the first argument). See the entry for
`new_recursive_definition` for details.

### Failure

As for `new_recursive_definition`.

### Example

Given the following primitive recursion theorem for labelled binary
trees:

``` hol4
   |- !f0 f1.
        ?fn.
          (!a. fn (LEAF a) = f0 a) /\
          !a0 a1. fn (NODE a0 a1) = f1 a0 a1 (fn a0) (fn a1) : thm
```

`prove_rec_fn_exists` can be used to prove the existence of primitive
recursive functions over binary trees. Suppose the value of `th` is this
theorem. Then the existence of a recursive function `Leaves`, which
computes the number of leaves in a binary tree, can be proved as shown
below:

``` hol4
   - prove_rec_fn_exists th
      ``(Leaves (LEAF (x:'a)) = 1) /\
        (Leaves (NODE t1 t2) = (Leaves t1) + (Leaves t2))``;
   > val it =
       |- ?Leaves.
            (!x. Leaves (LEAF x) = 1) /\
            !t1 t2. Leaves (NODE t1 t2) = Leaves t1 + Leaves t2 : thm
```

The result should be compared with the example given under
`new_recursive_definition`.
