\DOC THEN_TCL

\TYPE {THEN_TCL : (thm_tactical * thm_tactical -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Composes two theorem-tacticals.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
If {ttl1} and {ttl2} are two theorem-tacticals, {ttl1 THEN_TCL ttl2} is
a theorem-tactical which composes their effect; that is, if:
{
   ttl1 ttac th1 = ttac th2
}
and
{
   ttl2 ttac th2 = ttac th3
}
then
{
   (ttl1 THEN_TCL ttl2) ttac th1 = ttac th3
}


\FAILURE
The application of {THEN_TCL} to a pair of theorem-tacticals never fails.
