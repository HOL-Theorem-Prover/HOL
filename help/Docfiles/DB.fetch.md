## `fetch` {#DB.fetch}


```
fetch : string -> string -> thm
```



Fetch a theorem by theory and name.


An invocation `fetch thy name` searches through the currently loaded
theory segments in an attempt to find a theorem, axiom, or definition
 stored under `name` in theory `thy`.

### Failure

If the specified theorem, axiom, or definition cannot be located.

### Example

    
    - DB.fetch "bool" "NOT_FORALL_THM";
    > val it = |- !P. ~(!x. P x) = ?x. ~P x : thm
