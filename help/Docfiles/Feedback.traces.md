```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns a list of registered tracing variables.

The function `traces` is part of the interface to a collection of
variables that control the verboseness of various tools within the
system. Tracing can be useful both when debugging proofs (with the
simplifier for example), and also as a guide to how an automatic proof
is proceeding (with `mesonLib` for example).

### Failure

Never fails.
