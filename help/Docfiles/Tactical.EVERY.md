## `EVERY`

``` hol4
Tactical.EVERY : (tactic list -> tactic)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sequentially applies all the tactics in a given list of tactics.

When applied to a list of tactics `[T1; ... ;Tn]`, and a goal `g`, the
tactical `EVERY` applies each tactic in sequence to every subgoal
generated by the previous one. This can be represented as:

``` hol4
   EVERY [T1;...;Tn] = T1 THEN ... THEN Tn
```

If the tactic list is empty, the resulting tactic has no effect.

### Failure

The application of `EVERY` to a tactic list never fails. The resulting
tactic fails iff any of the component tactics do.

### Comments

It is possible to use `EVERY` instead of `THEN`, but probably
stylistically inferior. `EVERY` is more useful when applied to a list of
tactics generated by a function.
