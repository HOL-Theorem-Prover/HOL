\DOC forget_history

\TYPE {forget_history : unit -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Clears the proof history.

\DESCRIBE
The function {forget_history} is part of the subgoal package. A call to
{forget_history} clears the history of saved proof states.  Subsequent calls to
{backup} or {restart} will behave as if the initial goal was the state at the
time of the call to {forget_history}. For a description of the subgoal package,
see {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
The function {forget_history} only fails if no goalstack is being managed.

\USES
Hiding an automatic preprocessing phase of a proof before handing it to the user.
