\TYPE {permahide : term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Hide a constant so that its name doesn't overload to it.

\KEYWORDS
Parsing, printing.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {permahide c} where {c} is a constant removes any mapping
from {c}'s name to that string in the overloading map. This is done by
calling {remove_ovl_mapping}, which see.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term argument is not a constant.

\COMMENTS
This is a convenience wrapper for {remove_ovl_mapping}. It is not the
same as a “permanent” form of the related {hide} function. A call to
{hide s}, with {s} a string, clears all overloads to the string {s},
making that string parse to a variable when name resolution is
performed. By contrast, {permahide c} only adjusts the overloading
maps to and from {c}.

The intention is that {permahide} can be used in theory developments
where a constant is needed but contaminating the namespace with that
constant's name is not desired.
