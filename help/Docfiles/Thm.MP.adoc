MP                                                               (Thm)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MP : thm -> thm -> thm

SYNOPSIS
Implements the Modus Ponens inference rule.

KEYWORDS
rule, modus, ponens, implication.

DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- t1 ==> t2} and {A2 |- t1},
the inference rule {MP} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t2}.

    A1 |- t1 ==> t2   A2 |- t1
   ----------------------------  MP
          A1 u A2 |- t2

In common with the underlying {dest_imp} syntax function, {MP} treats
theorems with conclusions of the form {~p} as implications {p ==> F}.
This means that {MP} also has the following behaviour:

    A1 |- ~t1     A2 |- t1
   ------------------------  MP
         A1 u A2 |- F




FAILURE
Fails unless the first theorem is an implication (in the sense of
{dest_imp}) whose antecedent is the same as the conclusion of the
second theorem (up to alpha-conversion)
