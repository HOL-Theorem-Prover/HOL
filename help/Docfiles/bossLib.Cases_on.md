## `Cases_on` {#bossLib.Cases_on}


```
Cases_on : term quotation -> tactic
```



Performs case analysis on the type of a given term.


An application `Cases_on M` performs a case-split based on the type `ty`
of `M`, using the cases theorem for `ty` from the global `TypeBase`
database.

`Cases_on` can be used to specify variables that are buried
in the quantifier prefix. `Cases_on` can also be used to perform
case splits on non-variable terms. If `M` is a non-variable term that
does not occur bound in the goal, then the cases theorem is instantiated
with `M` and used to generate as many sub-goals as there are disjuncts
in the cases theorem.

### Failure

Fails if `ty` does not have a case theorem in the `TypeBase`.

### Example

None yet.
