## `EXISTS_EQ` {#Drule.EXISTS_EQ}


```
EXISTS_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)
```



Existentially quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.


When applied to a variable `x` and a theorem whose conclusion is
equational, `A |- t1 = t2`, the inference rule
`EXISTS_EQ` returns the theorem `A |- (?x. t1) = (?x. t2)`, provided
the variable `x` is not free in any of the assumptions.
    
             A |- t1 = t2
       ------------------------  EXISTS_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
        A |- (?x.t1) = (?x.t2)
    



### Failure

Fails unless the theorem is equational with both sides having type `bool`,
or if the term is not a variable, or if the variable to be quantified
over is free in any of the assumptions.
