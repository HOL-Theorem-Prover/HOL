## `ALL_TAC` {#Tactical.ALL_TAC}


```
ALL_TAC : tactic
```



Passes on a goal unchanged.


`ALL_TAC` applied to a goal `g` simply produces the subgoal list `[g]`. It is
the identity for the `THEN` tactical.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

The tactic
    
       INDUCT_THEN numTheory.INDUCTION THENL [ALL_TAC, tac]
    
applied to a goal `g`, applies `INDUCT_THEN numTheory.INDUCTION`
to `g` to give a basis and step subgoal; it then returns the
basis unchanged, along with the subgoals produced by applying `tac` to the
step.


Used to write tacticals such as `REPEAT`. Also, it is often used
as a place-holder in building compound tactics using tacticals such as
`THENL`.
