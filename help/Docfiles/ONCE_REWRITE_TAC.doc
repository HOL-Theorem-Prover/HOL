\DOC ONCE_REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {ONCE_REWRITE_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal only once with {basic_rewrites} and the supplied list
of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
A set of equational rewrites is generated from the theorems supplied
by the user and the set of basic tautologies, and these are used to
rewrite the goal at all subterms at which a match is found in one pass
over the term part of the goal. The result is returned without
recursively applying the rewrite theorems to it. The order in which
the given theorems are applied is an implementation matter and the user
should not depend on any ordering. More details about rewriting can be
found under {GEN_REWRITE_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} does not fail and does not diverge. It results in
an invalid tactic if any of the applied rewrites introduces new
assumptions to the theorem eventually proved.

\EXAMPLE
Given a theorem list:
{
  th1 = [ |- a = b; |- b = c; |- c = a]
}
\noindent the tactic {ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl} can be iterated as
required without diverging:
{
   #ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl ([], "P a");;
   ([([], "P b")], -) : subgoals
}
{
   #(ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl THEN ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl) ([], "P a");;
   ([([], "P c")], -) : subgoals
}
{
   #(ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl THEN ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl THEN ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl)
   #([], "P a");;
   ([([], "P a")], -) : subgoals
}
\USES
{ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} can be used iteratively to rewrite when recursive
rewriting would diverge.  It can also be used to save inference steps.
