\DOC top_goal

\TYPE {top_goal : unit -> term list * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the current goal of the subgoal package.

\DESCRIBE
The function {top_goal} is part of the subgoal package. It returns the top goal
of the goal stack in the current proof state.  For a description of the subgoal
package, see  {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
A call to {top_goal} will fail if there are no unproven goals. This could be
because no goal has been set using {set_goal} or because the last goal set has
been completely proved.

\USES
Examining the proof state after a proof fails.
