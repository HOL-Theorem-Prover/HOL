## `ALPHA_CONV` {#Drule.ALPHA_CONV}


```
ALPHA_CONV : term -> conv
```



Renames the bound variable of a lambda-abstraction.


If `x` is a variable of type `ty` and `M` is an abstraction (with
bound variable `y` of type `ty` and body `t`), then `ALPHA_CONV x M`
returns the theorem:
    
       |- (\y.t) = (\x'. t[x'/y])
    
where the variable `x':ty` is a primed variant of `x` chosen so
as not to be free in `\y.t`.

### Failure

`ALPHA_CONV x tm` fails if `x` is not a variable, if `tm` is not an
abstraction, or if `x` is a variable `v` and `tm` is a lambda abstraction
`\y.t` but the types of `v` and `y` differ.
