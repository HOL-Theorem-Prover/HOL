## `PSUB_CONV`

``` hol4
PairRules.PSUB_CONV : (conv -> conv)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applies a conversion to the top-level subterms of a term.

For any conversion `c`, the function returned by `PSUB_CONV c` is a
conversion that applies `c` to all the top-level subterms of a term. If
the conversion `c` maps `t` to `|- t = t'`, then `SUB_CONV c` maps a
paired abstraction `"\p.t"` to the theorem:

``` hol4
   |- (\p.t) = (\p.t')
```

That is, `PSUB_CONV c "\p.t"` applies `c` to the body of the paired
abstraction `"\p.t"`. If `c` is a conversion that maps `"t1"` to the
theorem `|- t1 = t1'` and `"t2"` to the theorem `|- t2 = t2'`, then the
conversion `PSUB_CONV c` maps an application `"t1 t2"` to the theorem:

``` hol4
   |- (t1 t2) = (t1' t2')
```

That is, `PSUB_CONV c "t1 t2"` applies `c` to the both the operator `t1`
and the operand `t2` of the application `"t1 t2"`. Finally, for any
conversion `c`, the function returned by `PSUB_CONV c` acts as the
identity conversion on variables and constants. That is, if `"t"` is a
variable or constant, then `PSUB_CONV c "t"` returns `|- t = t`.

### Failure

`PSUB_CONV c tm` fails if `tm` is a paired abstraction `"\p.t"` and the
conversion `c` fails when applied to `t`, or if `tm` is an application
`"t1 t2"` and the conversion `c` fails when applied to either `t1` or
`t2`. The function returned by `PSUB_CONV c` may also fail if the ML
function `c:term->thm` is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e.Â a function
that maps a term `t` to a theorem `|- t = t'`).
