\TYPE {NoAsms : thm}

\SYNOPSIS
A special marker theorem that makes the simplifier ignore a goal's assumptions

\KEYWORDS
simplification

\DESCRIBE
The {NoAsms} theorem is a special value that causes a variety of
simplification tactics (those ultimately based on
{simpLib.ASM_SIMP_TAC}) to ignore a goal's assumptions, even if those
tactics might otherwise attempt to use those assumptions when
modifying the goal. 

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
> simp[] ([“x = T”], “p ∧ x”);
val it = ([([“x ⇔ T”], “p”)], fn): goal list * validation

> simp[NoAsms] ([“x = T”], “p ∧ x”);
val it = ([([“x ⇔ T”], “p ∧ x”)], fn): goal list * validation
}
