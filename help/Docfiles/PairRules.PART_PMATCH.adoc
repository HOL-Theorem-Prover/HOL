PART_PMATCH : ((term -> term) -> thm -> term -> thm)

KEYWORDS
rule.

LIBRARY
pair

SYNOPSIS
Instantiates a theorem by matching part of it to a term.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a ‘selector’ function of type {term -> term}, a theorem and a
term:

   PART_MATCH fn (A |- !p1...pn. t) tm

the function {PART_PMATCH} applies {fn} to {t'} (the result
of specializing universally quantified pairs in the conclusion of
the theorem), and attempts to match the resulting term to the argument term
{tm}. If it succeeds, the appropriately instantiated version of the theorem is
returned.

FAILURE
Fails if the selector function {fn} fails when applied to the instantiated
theorem, or if the match fails with the term it has provided.

SEEALSO
Drule.PART_MATCH.
