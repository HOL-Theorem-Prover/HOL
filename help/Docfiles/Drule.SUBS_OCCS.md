## `SUBS_OCCS` {#Drule.SUBS_OCCS}


```
SUBS_OCCS : (int list * thm) list -> thm -> thm
```



Makes substitutions in a theorem at specific occurrences of a term, using a
list of equational theorems.


Given a list `(l1,A1|-t1=v1),...,(ln,An|-tn=vn)` and a theorem
`(A|-t)`, `SUBS_OCCS` simultaneously replaces each `ti` in `t` with `vi`,
at the occurrences specified by the integers
in the list `li = [o1,...,ok]` for each theorem `Ai|-ti=vi`.
    
         (l1,A1|-t1=v1) ... (ln,An|-tn=vn)  A|-t
       -------------------------------------------  SUBS_OCCS[(l1,A1|-t1=v1),...,
        A1 u ... An u A |- t[v1,...,vn/t1,...,tn]            (ln,An|-tn=vn)] (A|-t)
    



### Failure

`SUBS_OCCS [(l1,th1),...,(ln,thn)] (A|-t)` fails if
the conclusion of any theorem in the list is not an equation.
No change is made to the theorem if the supplied occurrences `li` of the
left-hand side of the conclusion of `thi` do not appear in `t`.

### Example

The commutative law for addition
    
       - val thm = SPECL [Term `m:num`, Term`n:num`] arithmeticTheory.ADD_SYM;
       > val thm = |- m + n = n + m : thm
    
can be used for substituting only the second occurrence of
the subterm `m + n`
    
       - SUBS_OCCS [([2],thm)]
                   (ASSUME (Term `(n + m) + (m + n) = (m + n) + (m + n)`));
       > val it =  [.] |- n + m + (m + n) = n + m + (m + n) : thm
    




`SUBS_OCCS` is used when rewriting at specific occurrences of a term, and rules
such as `REWRITE_RULE`, `PURE_REWRITE_RULE`, `ONCE_REWRITE_RULE`, and `SUBS`
are too extensive or would diverge.
