## `DISCARD_TAC` {#Tactic.DISCARD_TAC}


```
DISCARD_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Discards a theorem already present in a goal’s assumptions.


When applied to a theorem `A' |- s` and a goal, `DISCARD_TAC`
checks that `s` is simply `T` (true), or already exists (up
to alpha-conversion) in the assumption list of the goal. In
either case, the tactic has no effect. Otherwise, it fails.
    
        A ?- t
       ========  DISCARD_TAC (A' |- s)
        A ?- t
    



### Failure

Fails if the above conditions are not met, i.e. the theorem’s conclusion
is not `T` or already in the assumption list (up to alpha-conversion).
