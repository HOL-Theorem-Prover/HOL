## `STRUCT_CASES_TAC` {#Tactic.STRUCT_CASES_TAC}


```
STRUCT_CASES_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Performs very general structural case analysis.


When it is applied to a theorem of the form:
    
       th = A' |- ?y11...y1m. (x=t1) /\ (B11 /\ ... /\ B1k) \/ ... \/
                    ?yn1...ynp. (x=tn) /\ (Bn1 /\ ... /\ Bnp)
    
in which there may be no existential quantifiers where a ‘vector’ of
them is shown above, `STRUCT_CASES_TAC th` splits a goal `A ?- s` into `n`
subgoals as follows:
    
                                 A ?- s
       ===============================================================
        A u {B11,...,B1k} ?- s[t1/x] ... A u {Bn1,...,Bnp} ?- s[tn/x]
    
that is, performs a case split over the possible constructions (the
`ti`) of a term, providing as assumptions the given constraints, having
split conjoined constraints into separate assumptions. Note that unless `A'`
is a subset of `A`, this is an invalid tactic.

### Failure

Fails unless the theorem has the above form, namely a conjunction of
(possibly multiply existentially quantified) terms which assert the equality
of the same variable `x` and the given terms.

### Example

Suppose we have the goal:
    
      ?- ~(l:(*)list = []) ==> (LENGTH l) > 0
    
then we can get rid of the universal quantifier from the
inbuilt list theorem `list_CASES`:
    
       list_CASES = !l. (l = []) \/ (?t h. l = CONS h t)
    
and then use `STRUCT_CASES_TAC`. This amounts to applying the
following tactic:
    
       STRUCT_CASES_TAC (SPEC_ALL list_CASES)
    
which results in the following two subgoals:
    
       ?- ~(CONS h t = []) ==> (LENGTH(CONS h t)) > 0
    
       ?- ~([] = []) ==> (LENGTH[]) > 0
    
Note that this is a rather simple case, since there are no
constraints, and therefore the resulting subgoals have no assumptions.
