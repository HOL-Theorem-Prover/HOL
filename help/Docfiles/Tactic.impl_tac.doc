\TYPE {impl_tac : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Implements analogue of implication-left sequent calculus rule as tactic

\KEYWORDS
Tactic

\DESCRIBE
Given a goal of the form {A ?- ((p ==> q) ==> r)}, an application of
{impl_tac} will produce two sub-goals: {A ?- p} and {A ?- (q ==> r)}.
This can be useful if {p} should be dealt with in isolation, when,
say, the tactics that solve {p} can't safely be applied to {q} and/or
{r}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is not an implication with another implication as
its antecdent. Note that for the purpose of this tactic, a negation
{~p} is viewed as the implication {p ==> F}. This means that
{impl_tac} will succeed when applied to goals whose conclusions are
{~p ==> q}, {~(p ==> q)} and {~~p}.
