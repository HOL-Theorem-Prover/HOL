## `SELECT_INTRO` {#Drule.SELECT_INTRO}


```
SELECT_INTRO : (thm -> thm)
```



Introduces an epsilon term.


`SELECT_INTRO` takes a theorem with an applicative conclusion, say
`P x`, and returns a theorem with the epsilon term `$@ P` in place
of the original operand `x`.
    
         A |- P x
       --------------  SELECT_INTRO
        A |- P($@ P)
    
The returned theorem asserts that `$@ P` denotes some value
at which `P` holds.

### Failure

Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an application.

### Example

Given the theorem
    
       th1 = |- (\n. m = n)m
    
applying `SELECT_INTRO` replaces the second occurrence of `m` with the
epsilon abstraction of the operator:
    
       - val th2 = SELECT_INTRO th1;
       val th2 = |- (\n. m = n)(@n. m = n) : thm
    
This theorem could now be used to derive a further result:
    
       - EQ_MP (BETA_CONV(concl th2)) th2;
       val it = |- m = (@n. m = n) : thm
