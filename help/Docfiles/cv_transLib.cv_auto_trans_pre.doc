\TYPE {cv_auto_trans_pre : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Translates functional definitions to the {cv_compute} subset of HOL.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
This is a recursive version of {cv_transLib.cv_trans_pre}. During translation
of the given HOL function, {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre} will call itself
recursively on the definitions of any not-yet-translated constants it
encounters.

As with all {auto} variants, {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre} can sometimes
translate uses of higher-order functions, such as {MAP}.

\FAILURE
When the translation produces a precondition that {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre}
cannot prove automatically, or {cv_transLib.cv_termination_tac} fails to prove
the termination goal of either a recursively translated function or the
top-level translator-defined {:cv} function. For a failure on the top-level
function, the termination goal is pushed onto the goal stack.

\EXAMPLE
See {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans} and {cv_transLib.cv_trans_pre} for
relevant examples.

\COMMENTS
Designed to produce definitions suitable for evaluation by {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.
