end_time                                                         (Lib)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
end_time : Timer.cpu_timer -> unit

SYNOPSIS
Check a running timer, and print out how long it has been running.

KEYWORDS
time.

DESCRIBE
An application {end_time timer}	looks to see how long {timer} has been
running, and prints out the elapsed runtime, garbage collection time,
and system time.

FAILURE
Never fails.

EXAMPLE

- val clock = start_time();
> val clock = <cpu_timer> : cpu_timer

- use "foo.sml";
> ... output omitted ...

- end_time clock;
runtime: 525.996s,    gctime: 0.000s,     systime: 525.996s.
> val it = () : unit




COMMENTS
A {start_time} ... {end_time} pair is for use when calling {time}
would be clumsy, e.g., when multiple function applications are to
be timed.

SEEALSO
Lib.start_time, Lib.time.
