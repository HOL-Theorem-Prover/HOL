## `insert` {#Lib.insert}


```
insert ''a -> ''a list -> ''a list
```



Add an element to a list if it is not already there.


If `x` is already in `list`, then `insert x list` equals `list`.
Otherwise, `x` becomes an element of `list`.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - insert 1 [3,2];
    > val it = [1, 3, 2] : int list
    
    - insert 1 it;
    > val it = [1, 3, 2] : int list
    



### Comments

In some programming situations, it is convenient to implement sets
by lists, in which case `insert` may be helpful. However, such
an implementation is only suitable for small sets.

A high-performance implementation of finite sets may be found in
structure `HOLset`.

ML equality types are used in the implementation of `insert` and its kin.
This limits its applicability to types that allow equality. For other
types, typically abstract ones, use the ‘op_’ variants.

One should not write code that depends on where the ‘list-as-set’
algorithms place elements in the list which is being considered as a
set.
