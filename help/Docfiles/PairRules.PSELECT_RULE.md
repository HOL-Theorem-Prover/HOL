## `PSELECT_RULE` {#PairRules.PSELECT_RULE}


```
PSELECT_RULE : (thm -> thm)
```



Introduces a paired epsilon term in place of a paired existential quantifier.


The inference rule `PSELECT_RULE` expects a theorem asserting the
existence of a pair `p` such that `t` holds.  The equivalent assertion
that the epsilon term `@p.t` denotes a pair `p` for
which `t` holds is returned as a theorem.
    
           A |- ?p. t
       ------------------  PSELECT_RULE
        A |- t[(@p.t)/p]
    



### Failure

Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
a paired existential quantifier.
