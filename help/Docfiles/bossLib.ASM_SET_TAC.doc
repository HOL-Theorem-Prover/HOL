\DOC ASM_SET_TAC

\TYPE {ASM_SET_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Tactic to automate some routine set theory by reduction to FOL,
using the assumptions and the theorems given.

\KEYWORDS
decision procedure, tactic.

\LIBRARY
boss

\DESCRIBE
{ASM_SET_TAC} is identical in behaviour to {SET_TAC} except that
it uses the assumptions of a goal as well as the provided theorems.

\FAILURE
Fails if the underlying resolution machinery ({METIS_TAC}) cannot
prove the goal, or the supplied theorems (and the assumptions) are not
enough for the FOL reduction.
