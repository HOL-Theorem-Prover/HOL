## `HO_MATCH_ABBREV_TAC` {#Q.HO_MATCH_ABBREV_TAC}


```
Q.HO_MATCH_ABBREV_TAC : term quotation -> tactic
```



Introduces abbreviations by doing a higher-order match against the goal.


This tactic is just like `Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC`, but does a higher-order
match against the goal rather than a first order match.  See the
documentation for `MATCH_ABBREV_TAC` for more details.

### Example

The goal
    
       ?- !n. (n + 1) * (n - 1) = n * n - 1
    
is transformed by `` Q.HO_MATCH_ABBREV_TAC `!k. P k` `` to
    
       Abbrev(P = (\n. (n + 1) * (n - 1) = n * n - 1)) ?-  !k. P k
    
Note how the bound variable changes to match that used in the pattern.
