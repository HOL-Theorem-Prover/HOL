RESQ_SPEC : term -> thm -> thm

SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a possibly-restricted universally quantified
theorem.

KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {u} and a theorem {A |- !x::P. t}, {RESQ_SPEC}
returns the theorem {A, u IN P |- t[u/x]}. If necessary, variables
will be renamed prior to the specialization to ensure that {u} is free
for {x} in {t}, that is, no variables free in {u} become bound after
substitution.

      A |- !x::P. t
   ---------------------  RESQ_SPEC "u"
    A, u IN P |- t[u/x]

Additionally, if the input theorem is a standard universal
quantification, then RESQ_SPEC behaves like SPEC.

FAILURE
Fails if the theorem’s conclusion is not restricted universally quantified,
or if type instantiation fails.
