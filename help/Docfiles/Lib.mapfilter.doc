\TYPE {mapfilter : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list}

\SYNOPSIS
Like map, but drops elements that raise exceptions.

\DESCRIBE
Applies a function to every element of a list, returning a list of
results for those elements for which application succeeds. The
function is applied to the elements of the list from left to right
(which is significant if its action includes side effects).

\KEYWORDS
list.

\FAILURE
If {f x} raises {Interrupt} for some element {x} of {l}, then
{mapfilter f l} fails (with an {Interrupt} exception).

\EXAMPLE
{
- mapfilter hd [[1,2,3],[4,5],[],[6,7,8],[]];
> val it = [1, 4, 6] : int list
}
