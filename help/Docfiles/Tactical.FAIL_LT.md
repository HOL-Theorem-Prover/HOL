## `FAIL_LT` {#Tactical.FAIL_LT}


```
FAIL_LT : string -> list_tactic
```



List-tactic which always fails, with the supplied string.


Whatever goal list it is applied to, `FAIL_LT s` always fails
with the string `s`.

### Failure

The application of `FAIL_LT` to a string never fails; the resulting
list-tactic always fails.
