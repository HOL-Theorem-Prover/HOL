\DOC deprecate_int

\TYPE {intLib.deprecate_int : unit -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes the parser never consider integers as a numeric possibility.

\DESCRIBE
Calling {deprecate_int()} causes the parser to remove all of the
standard numeric constants over the integers from consideration.  In
addition to the standard operators ({+}, {-}, {*} and others), this
also affects numerals; after the call to {deprecate_int} these will
never be parsed as integers.

This function, by affecting the global grammar, also affects the
behaviour of the pretty-printer.  A term that includes affected
constants will print with those constants in ``fully qualified form'',
typically as {integer$op}, and numerals will simply print with a
trailing {i}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
First we load the integer library, ensuring that integers and natural
numbers both are possible when we type numeric expressions:
{
   - load "intLib";
   > val it = () : unit
}
Then, when we type such an expression, we're warned that this is
strictly ambiguous, and a type is silently chosen for us:
{
   - val t = ``2 + x``;
   <<HOL message: more than one resolution of overloading was possible>>
   > val t = ``2 + x`` : term

   - type_of t;
   > val it = ``:int`` : hol_type
}
Now we can use {deprecate_int} to stop this happening, and make sure
that we just get natural numbers:
{
   - intLib.deprecate_int();
   > val it = () : unit

   - ``2 + x``;
   > val it = ``2 + x`` : term

   - type_of it;
   > val it = ``:num`` : hol_type
}
The term we started out with, is now printed in rather ugly fashion:
{
   - t;
   > val it = ``integer$int_add 2i x`` : term
}

\COMMENT
If one wishes to simply prefer the natural numbers, say, to the
integers, and yet still retain integers as a possibility, use
{numLib.prefer_num} rather than this function.
