## `cons` {#Lib.cons}


```
cons : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list
```



Curried form of list cons operation.


In some programming situations it is handy to use the "cons"
operation in a curried form. Although it is easy to code up on demand,
the `cons` function is provided for convenience.

### Failure

Never fails.

### Example

    
    - map (cons 1) [[],[2],[2,3]];
    > val it = [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]] : int list list
