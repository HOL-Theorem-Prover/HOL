## `SUBS` {#Drule.SUBS}


```
SUBS : (thm list -> thm -> thm)
```



Makes simple term substitutions in a theorem using a given list of theorems.


Term substitution in HOL is performed by replacing free subterms according to
the transformations specified by a list of equational theorems.  Given a list
of theorems `A1|-t1=v1,...,An|-tn=vn` and a theorem `A|-t`, `SUBS`
simultaneously replaces each free occurrence of `ti` in `t` with `vi`:
    
              A1|-t1=v1 ... An|-tn=vn    A|-t
       ---------------------------------------------  SUBS[A1|-t1=v1;...;An|-tn=vn]
        A1 u ... u An u A |- t[v1,...,vn/t1,...,tn]       (A|-t)
    
No matching is involved; the occurrence of each `ti` being
substituted for must be a free in `t` (see `SUBST_MATCH`).  An occurrence which
is not free can be substituted by using rewriting rules such as `REWRITE_RULE`,
`PURE_REWRITE_RULE` and `ONCE_REWRITE_RULE`.

### Failure

`SUBS [th1,...,thn] (A|-t)` fails if the conclusion of each theorem in the list
is not an equation.  No change is made to the theorem `A |- t` if no occurrence
of any left-hand side of the supplied equations appears in `t`.

### Example

Substitutions are made with the theorems
    
       - val thm1 = SPECL [Term`m:num`, Term`n:num`] arithmeticTheory.ADD_SYM
         val thm2 = CONJUNCT1 arithmeticTheory.ADD_CLAUSES;
       > val thm1 = |- m + n = n + m : thm
         val thm2 = |- 0 + m = m : thm
    
depending on the occurrence of free subterms
    
       - SUBS [thm1, thm2] (ASSUME (Term `(n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n`));
       > val it =  [.] |- n + 0 + m = n + m : thm
    
       - SUBS [thm1, thm2] (ASSUME (Term `!n. (n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n`));
       > val it =  [.] |- !n. n + 0 + m = m + n : thm
    




`SUBS` can sometimes be used when rewriting (for example, with `REWRITE_RULE`)
would diverge and term instantiation is not needed.  Moreover, applying the
substitution rules is often much faster than using the rewriting rules.
