\DOC LAST_ASSUME_TAC

\TYPE {LAST_ASSUME_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds an assumption to the top of the assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem {th} of the form {A' |- u}, and a goal, {LAST_ASSUME_TAC th}
adds {u} to the assumptions of the goal.
{
         A ?- t
    ==============  LAST_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- u)
     {u} u A ?- t
}
Note that unless {A'} is a subset of {A}, this tactic is invalid.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
{LAST_ASSUME_TAC} is the naive way of manipulating assumptions (i.e. without
recourse to advanced tacticals); and it is useful for enriching the assumption
list with lemmas as a prelude to resolution ({RES_TAC}, {IMP_RES_TAC}),
rewriting with assumptions ({ASM_REWRITE_TAC} and so on), and other operations
involving assumptions.
