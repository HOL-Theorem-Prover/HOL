## `REDEPTH_CONV` {#Conv.REDEPTH_CONV}


```
REDEPTH_CONV : (conv -> conv)
```



Applies a conversion bottom-up to all subterms, retraversing changed ones.


`REDEPTH_CONV c tm` applies the conversion `c` repeatedly to all subterms of
the term `tm` and recursively applies `REDEPTH_CONV c` to each subterm at which
`c` succeeds, until there is no subterm remaining for which application of `c`
succeeds.

More precisely, `REDEPTH_CONV c tm` repeatedly applies the conversion `c` to
all the subterms of the term `tm`, including the term `tm` itself. The supplied
conversion `c` is applied to the subterms of `tm` in bottom-up order and is
applied repeatedly (zero or more times, as is done by `REPEATC`) to each
subterm until it fails.  If `c` is successfully applied at least once to a
subterm, `t` say, then the term into which `t` is transformed is retraversed by
applying `REDEPTH_CONV c` to it.

### Failure

`REDEPTH_CONV c tm` never fails but can diverge if the conversion `c` can be
applied repeatedly to some subterm of `tm` without failing.

### Example

The following example shows how `REDEPTH_CONV` retraverses subterms:
    
       - REDEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\f x. (f x) + 1) (\y.y) 2`);
       val it = |- (\f x. (f x) + 1)(\y. y)2 = 2 + 1 : thm
    
Here, `BETA_CONV` is first applied successfully to the (beta-redex)
subterm:
    
       (\f x. (f x) + 1) (\y.y)
    
This application reduces this subterm to:
    
       (\x. ((\y.y) x) + 1)
    
`REDEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV` is then recursively applied to this
transformed subterm, eventually reducing it to `(\x. x + 1)`. Finally, a
beta-reduction of the top-level term, now the simplified beta-redex
`(\x. x + 1) 2`, produces `2 + 1`.

### Comments

The implementation of this function uses failure to avoid rebuilding
unchanged subterms. That is to say, during execution the exception
`QConv.UNCHANGED` may be generated and later trapped. The behaviour of
the function is dependent on this use of failure. So, if the
conversion given as an argument happens to generate the same
exception, the operation of `REDEPTH_CONV` will be unpredictable.
