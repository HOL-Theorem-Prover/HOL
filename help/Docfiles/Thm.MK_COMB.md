## `MK_COMB` {#Thm.MK_COMB}


```
MK_COMB : thm * thm -> thm
```



Proves equality of combinations constructed from equal
functions and operands.


When applied to theorems `A1 |- f = g` and `A2 |- x = y`, the inference
rule `MK_COMB` returns the theorem `A1 u A2 |- f x = g y`.
    
        A1 |- f = g   A2 |- x = y
       ---------------------------  MK_COMB
           A1 u A2 |- f x = g y
    



### Failure

Fails unless both theorems are equational and `f` and `g` are
functions whose domain types are the same as the types of `x` and `y`
respectively.
