## `RES_SELECT_CONV` {#res_quanLib.RES_SELECT_CONV}


```
RES_SELECT_CONV : conv
```



Converts a restricted choice quantification to a conjunction.


When applied to a term of the form `@x::P. Q[x]`, the conversion
`RES_SELECT_CONV` returns the theorem:
    
       |- @x::P. Q[x] = (@x. x IN P /\ Q[x])
    
which is the underlying semantic representation of the restricted
choice quantification.

### Failure

Fails if applied to a term not of the form `@x::P. Q`.
