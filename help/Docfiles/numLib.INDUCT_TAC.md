## `INDUCT_TAC` {#numLib.INDUCT_TAC}


```
INDUCT_TAC : tactic
```



Performs tactical proof by mathematical induction on the natural numbers.


`INDUCT_TAC` reduces a goal `!n.P[n]`, where `n` has type `num`, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by mathematical
induction on `n`. The induction hypothesis appears among the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of `INDUCT_TAC` is:
    
                    A ?- !n. P
        ========================================  INDUCT_TAC
         A ?- P[0/n]     A u {P} ?- P[SUC n'/n]
    
where `n'` is a primed variant of `n` that does not appear free in
the assumptions `A` (usually, `n'` just equals `n`). When `INDUCT_TAC` is
applied to a goal of the form `!n.P`, where `n` does not appear free in `P`,
the subgoals are just `A ?- P` and `A u {P} ?- P`.

### Failure

`INDUCT_TAC g` fails unless the conclusion of the goal `g` has the form `!n.t`,
where the variable `n` has type `num`.
