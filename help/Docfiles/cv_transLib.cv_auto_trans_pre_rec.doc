\TYPE {cv_auto_trans_pre_rec : thm -> tactic -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Translates functional definitions to the {cv_compute} subset of HOL.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
This is a recursive version of {cv_transLib.cv_trans_pre_rec}. During
translation of the given HOL function, {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre_rec} will
call itself recursively on the definitions of any not-yet-translated constants
it encounters.

As with all {auto} variants, {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre_rec} can sometimes
translate uses of higher-order functions, such as {MAP}.

\FAILURE
When the translation produces a precondition that
{cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans_pre_rec} cannot prove automatically, or
{cv_transLib.cv_termination_tac} fails to prove the termination goal of any
recursively translated function, or the provided tactic fails to prove the
termination goal of the top-level translator-defined {:cv} function.

\EXAMPLE
See {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans} and {cv_transLib.cv_trans_pre_rec} for
relevant examples.

\COMMENTS
Designed to produce definitions suitable for evaluation by {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.
