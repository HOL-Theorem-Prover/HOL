## `THEN1` {#Tactical.THEN1}


```
op THEN1 : tactic * tactic -> tactic
```



A tactical like `THEN` that applies the second tactic only to the
first subgoal.


If `T1` and `T2` are tactics, `T1 THEN1 T2` is a tactic which applies
`T1` to a goal, then applies the tactic `T2` to the first subgoal
generated. `T1` must produce at least one subgoal, and `T2` must
completely solve the first subgoal of `T1`.

### Failure

The application of `THEN1` to a pair of tactics never fails.  The
resulting tactic fails if `T1` fails when applied to the goal, if `T1`
does not produce at least one subgoal (i.e., `T1` completely solves
the goal), or if `T2` does not completely solve the first subgoal
generated by `T1`.

### Comments

`THEN1` can be applied to make the proof more linear, avoiding
unnecessary `THENL`s. It is especially useful when used with
`REVERSE`.

### Example

For example, given the goal
    
       simple_goal /\ complicated_goal
    
the tactic
    
       (CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0)
       THEN T1
       THEN T2
       THEN ...
       THEN Tn
    
avoids the extra indentation of
    
       CONJ_TAC THENL
       [T0,
        T1
        THEN T2
        THEN ...
        THEN Tn]
