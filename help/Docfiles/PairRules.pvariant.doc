\TYPE {pvariant : (term list -> term -> term)}

\LIBRARY
pair

\SYNOPSIS
Modifies variable and constant names in a paired structure to avoid clashes.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of (possibly paired structures of) variables to avoid
clashing with, and a pair to modify, {pvariant} returns a variant of the pair.
That is, it changes the names of variables and constants in the pair as
intuitively as possible to make them distinct from any variables in the list,
or any (non-hidden) constants.
This is normally done by adding primes to the names.

The exact form of the altered names should not be relied on,
except that the original variables will be unmodified unless they
are in the list to avoid clashing with.
Also note that if the same variable occurs more that one in the pair,
then each instance of the variable will be modified in the same way.

\FAILURE
{pvariant l p} fails if any term in the list {l} is not a paired structure of
variables, or if {p} is not a paired structure of variables and constants.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows a case that exhibits most possible behaviours:
{
   - pvariant [Term `b:'a`, Term `(c:'a,c':'a)`]
              (Term `((a:'a,b:'a),(c:'a,b':'a,T,b:'a))`);
   val it = `(a,b''),c'',b',T',b''` : term
}


\USES
The function {pvariant} is extremely useful for complicated derived rules which
need to rename pairs variable to avoid free variable capture while still
making the role of the pair obvious to the user.
