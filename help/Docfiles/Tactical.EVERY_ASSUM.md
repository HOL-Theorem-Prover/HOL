## `EVERY_ASSUM` {#Tactical.EVERY_ASSUM}


```
EVERY_ASSUM : (thm_tactic -> tactic)
```



Sequentially applies all tactics given by mapping a function over the
assumptions of a goal.


When applied to a theorem-tactic `f` and a goal `({A1,...,An} ?- C)`, the
`EVERY_ASSUM` tactical maps `f` over a list of `ASSUME`d assumptions then
applies the resulting tactics, in sequence, to the goal:
    
       EVERY_ASSUM f ({A1,...,An} ?- C)
        = (f(A1 |- A1) THEN ... THEN f(An |- An)) ({A1,...,An} ?- C)
    
If the goal has no assumptions, then `EVERY_ASSUM` has no effect.

### Failure

The application of `EVERY_ASSUM` to a theorem-tactic and a goal fails
if the theorem-tactic fails when applied to any of the `ASSUME`d assumptions
of the goal, or if any of the resulting tactics fail when applied
sequentially.
