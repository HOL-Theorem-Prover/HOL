## `X_CHOOSE_TAC` {#Tactic.X_CHOOSE_TAC}


```
X_CHOOSE_TAC : term -> thm_tactic
```



Assumes a theorem, with existentially quantified variable replaced by a given
witness.


`X_CHOOSE_TAC` expects a variable `y` and theorem with an existentially
quantified conclusion.  When applied to a goal, it adds a new
assumption obtained by introducing the variable `y` as a witness for
the object `x` whose existence is asserted in the theorem.
    
               A ?- t
       ===================  X_CHOOSE_TAC y (A1 |- ?x. w)
        A u {w[y/x]} ?- t         (y not free anywhere)
    



### Failure

Fails if the theoremâ€™s conclusion is not existentially quantified, or
if the first argument is not a variable. Failures may arise in the
tactic-generating function. An invalid tactic is produced if the
introduced variable is free in `w`, `t` or `A`, or if the theorem has
any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an assumption of the
goal.

### Example

Given a goal of the form
    
       {n < m} ?- ?x. m = n + (x + 1)
    
the following theorem may be applied:
    
       th = [n < m] |- ?p. m = n + p
    
by the tactic `` (X_CHOOSE_TAC (Term`q:num`) th) `` giving
the subgoal:
    
       {n < m, m = n + q} ?- ?x. m = n + (x + 1)
