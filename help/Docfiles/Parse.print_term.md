## `print_term` {#Parse.print_term}


```
Parse.print_term : term -> unit
```



Prints a term to the screen (standard out).


The function `print_term` prints a term to the screen.  It first
converts the term into a string, and then outputs that string to the
standard output stream.

The conversion to the string is done by `term_to_string`.  The term is
printed using the pretty-printing information contained in the global
grammar.

### Failure
