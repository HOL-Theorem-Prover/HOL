## `print_term`

``` hol4
Parse.print_term : term -> unit
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prints a term to the screen (standard out).

The function `print_term` prints a term to the screen. It first converts
the term into a string, and then outputs that string to the standard
output stream.

The conversion to the string is done by `term_to_string`. The term is
printed using the pretty-printing information contained in the global
grammar.

### Failure

Should never fail.
