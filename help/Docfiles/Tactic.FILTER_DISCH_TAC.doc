\DOC FILTER_DISCH_TAC

\TYPE {FILTER_DISCH_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conditionally moves the antecedent of an implicative goal into the assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, undischarge, antecedent.

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC} will move the antecedent of an implication into the
assumptions, provided its parameter does not occur in the antecedent.
{
    A ?- u ==> v
   ==============  FILTER_DISCH_TAC w
    A u {u} ?- v
}
Note that {DISCH_TAC} treats {~u} as {u ==> F}. Unlike
{DISCH_TAC}, the antecedent will be {STRIP}ed into its various components
before being {ASSUME}d. This stripping includes generating multiple goals for
case-analysis of disjunctions. Also, unlike {DISCH_TAC}, should any component
of the discharged antecedent directly imply or contradict the goal, then this
simplification will also be made. Again, unlike {DISCH_TAC}, {FILTER_DISCH_TAC}
will not duplicate identical or alpha-equivalent assumptions.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC} will fail if a term which is identical, or alpha-equivalent
to {w} occurs free in the antecedent, or if the theorem is not an implication
or a negation.

\COMMENTS
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC w} behaves like {FILTER_DISCH_THEN STRIP_ASSUME_TAC w}.
