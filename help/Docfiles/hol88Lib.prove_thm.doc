\DOC prove_thm

\TYPE {prove_thm : (string * term * tactic) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic, then save the
theorem.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a triple {(s,tm,tac)},
giving the name to save the theorem under, the term to prove (with no
assumptions) and the tactic to perform the proof, the function
{prove_thm} attempts to prove the goal {?- tm}, that is, the term {tm}
with no assumptions, using the tactic {tac}. If {prove_thm} succeeds, it
attempts to save the resulting theorem in the current theory segment,
and if this succeeds, the saved theorem is returned.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.
In addition, {prove_thm} will fail if the theorem cannot be saved, e.g. because
there is already a theorem of that name in the current theory segment, or if
the resulting theorem has assumptions; clearly this can only happen if the
tactic was invalid, so this gives some measure of validity checking. The 
function is not available unless the hol88 library has been loaded.

\COMMENTS
In hol90, use {store_thm} instead; the cognitive dissonance between {prove}, 
{PROVE}, and {prove_thm} proved to be too much for the author, so in hol90 
{PROVE} doesn't exist: there is only {prove}; and {prove_thm} doesn't exist: 
it has been replaced by {store_thm}.
