## `PMATCH_MP_TAC` {#PairRules.PMATCH_MP_TAC}


```
PMATCH_MP_TAC : thm_tactic
```



Reduces the goal using a supplied implication, with matching.


When applied to a theorem of the form
    
       A' |- !p1...pn. s ==> !q1...qm. t
    
`PMATCH_MP_TAC` produces a tactic that reduces a goal whose
conclusion `t'` is a substitution and/or type instance of `t` to the
corresponding instance of `s`. Any variables free in `s` but not in `t` will
be existentially quantified in the resulting subgoal:
    
         A ?- !u1...ui. t'
      ======================  PMATCH_MP_TAC (A' |- !p1...pn. s ==> !q1...qm. t)
         A ?- ?w1...wp. s'
    
where `w1`, ..., `wp` are (type instances of) those pairs among
`p1`, ..., `pn` having variables that do not occur free in `t`.
Note that this is not a valid tactic unless `A'` is a subset of `A`.

### Failure

Fails unless the theorem is an (optionally paired universally quantified)
implication whose consequent can be instantiated to match the goal.
The generalized pairs `u1`, ..., `ui` must occur in `s'` in order for the
conclusion `t` of the supplied theorem to match `t'`.
