## `class`

``` hol4
DB.datatype class
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datatype for classifying theory elements.

Many of the functions in the `DB` structure return answers that involve
the `class` type, which is declared as

``` hol4
   datatype class = Thm | Axm | Def
```

When occurring with `th`, an ML value of type `thm`, `Axm` means that
`th` has been asserted as an axiom; `Def` means that `th` is a constant
definition; and `Thm` means that `th` is a plain old theorem, i.e,. not
an axiom or a definition.
