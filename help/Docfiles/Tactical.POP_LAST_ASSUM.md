## `POP_LAST_ASSUM` {#Tactical.POP_LAST_ASSUM}


```
POP_LAST_ASSUM : thm_tactic -> tactic
```



Applies tactic generated from the last element of a goalâ€™s assumption list.


When applied to a theorem-tactic and a goal, `POP_LAST_ASSUM` applies
the theorem-tactic to the `ASSUME`d last element of the assumption
list, and applies the resulting tactic to the goal without that
assumption in its assumption list:
    
       POP_LAST_ASSUM f ({A1,...,Am,An} ?- t) = f (An |- An) ({A1,...,Am} ?- t)
    



### Failure

Fails if the assumption list of the goal is empty, or the theorem-tactic
fails when applied to the popped assumption, or if the resulting tactic
fails when applied to the goal (with depleted assumption list).

### Comments

The tactical `POP_LAST_ASSUM` is also available under the lower-case
version of the name, `pop_last_assum`.
