## `STRIP_GOAL_THEN` {#Tactic.STRIP_GOAL_THEN}


```
STRIP_GOAL_THEN : thm_tactic -> tactic
```



Splits a goal by eliminating one outermost connective, applying the
given theorem-tactic to the antecedents of implications.


Given a theorem-tactic `ttac` and a goal `(A,t)`, `STRIP_GOAL_THEN` removes one
outermost occurrence of one of the connectives `!`, `==>`, `~` or `/\` from the
conclusion of the goal `t`.  If `t` is a universally quantified term, then
`STRIP_GOAL_THEN` strips off the quantifier:
    
          A ?- !x.u
       ==============  STRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
         A ?- u[x'/x]
    
where `x'` is a primed variant that does not appear free in the
assumptions `A`.  If `t` is a conjunction, then `STRIP_GOAL_THEN` simply splits
the conjunction into two subgoals:
    
          A ?- v /\ w
       =================  STRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
        A ?- v   A ?- w
    
If `t` is an implication `u ==> v` and if:
    
          A ?- v
      ===============  ttac (u |- u)
         A' ?- v'
    
then:
    
          A ?- u ==> v
      ====================  STRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
            A' ?- v'
    
Finally, a negation `~t` is treated as the implication `t ==> F`.

### Failure

`STRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac (A,t)` fails if `t` is not a universally quantified term,
an implication, a negation or a conjunction.  Failure also occurs if the
application of `ttac` fails, after stripping the goal.

### Example

When solving the goal
    
       ?- (n = 1) ==> (n * n = n)
    
a possible initial step is to apply
    
       STRIP_GOAL_THEN SUBST1_TAC
    
thus obtaining the goal
    
       ?- 1 * 1 = 1
    




`STRIP_GOAL_THEN` is used when manipulating intermediate results (obtained by
stripping outer connectives from a goal) directly, rather than as assumptions.
