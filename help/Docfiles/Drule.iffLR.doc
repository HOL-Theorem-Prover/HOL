\TYPE {iffLR : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the left-to-right direction of a “guarded” iff theorem

\KEYWORDS
Derived rule

\DESCRIBE
A call to {iffLR th}, where {th} has the form
{
   A |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==> (l <=> r)
}
returns the left-to-right implication
{
   A |- !x1 .. xn. p1 /\ .. /\ pm ==> !y... q1 /\ .. ==> ... ==> l ==> r
}
The universal variables and various antecedents are said to “guard”
the if-and-only-if conclusion {l <=> r} in this situation. They may be
nested abitrarily deep, or not present at all. They are restored after
a call to {EQ_IMP_RULE} is made.

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not of the form specified above.
