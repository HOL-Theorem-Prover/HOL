This directory contains various programs used to generate help
facilities of various kinds for the HOL system. We have adapted (in an
extremely ugly way) some code used to generate help files for
MoscowML. The notice from that code is appended.

Currently, we do the following:

  0. Translate all files in help/Docfiles into a database usable by
     invoking "help" interactively.

  1. Translate all files in help/Docfiles into HTML versions
     (via Doc2Html).

  2. Translate all signature files found in <holdir>/sigobj into
     HTML versions. Links for all value bindings are resolved to
     the results of (1), if possible. Theory signatures are internally
     linked to provide efficient access. A signature file contains a
     link to its source.

  3. Generate an index of all HOL identifiers, with links to the
     documentation, and the host signature.

  4. Generate a HOLPage which brings all the above together on one
     sheet.

To add documentation, one simply adds the ".doc" format files into
the directory help/Docfiles. Each file must have the format

   <structure-name>.<id>.doc  or
   <structure-name>.doc

If <id> is a symbolic identifier (not alphanumeric) then an alphanumeric
name <alpha> has to be invented for it. Thus the file name will be
<structure-name>.<alpha>.doc. The structure "Symbolic" must then be
augmented as well, in order that the system can do the proper
translations between <id> and <alpha>. See

    help/Docfiles/Parse.minus2.doc 

for an example, noting well how alphanumeric variants are *not* used in
the SEEALSO field.

This directory contains the program used to create the database used
by the Moscow ML `help' function.  It will not work under MS DOS
because of the filename name truncation in DOS.

The program illustrates the use of several libraries.

The main program is makebase.  It reads the signatures in directory
mosml/lib/ and creates 

    * a help database in helpsigs.val
    * an ASCII format version of the database in index.txt
    * a LaTeX format version of the database in ../index.tex
    * HTML versions of the signature files, and an identifier index,
      with hyperlinks, in directory htmlsigs
    * a LaTeX format version of the signature files, with layout and 
      \index{...} markup, in file ../texsigsigs.tex 

To create the main program, type        

        make

To run the program thus compiled, type

        makebase

The program handles only signatures for (old) Moscow ML structure-mode
unit interfaces, as used in the Moscow ML library.
