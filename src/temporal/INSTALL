Installation
============

In normal circumstances, all you have to do is

   1. Enter the "src" directory and type "Holmake". You should first
      set up the variables "smv_path" and "smv_call" in
      src/temporalLib.sml. The first one contains the path
      where the executable file of the smv system is located, and the
      second contains a call with suitable parameters.

   2. Build a copy of smv.

The first command will build the HOL theories and conversions of the
"temporal" library. The second will build the SMV executable.

The library can be accessed simply by invoking

   load "temporalLib";

in a Hol98 session. Some examples of usage of the library are in the
file "examples.sml". The reference variables smv_path, smv_call, and
smv_tmp_dir in temporalLib can be used to set the path to SMV, the
format of a call to SMV, and a temporary directory used for the
translation, respectively.
