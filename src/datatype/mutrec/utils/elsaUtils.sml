(* Proof Rules *)


(*
  STRONG_INST, STRONG_INST_TY_TERM and STRONG_INST are like INST, INST_TY_TERM
  and INST, except that they instantiate free variables in the hypotheses,
  rather than failing.  I have also changed the type of their arguments to
  use records to state more explictly which piece of the substitution
  information is the variable bieng substituted for and which piece is the
  expression being substituted.

   goal statement.  It also solves those subgoals which match any of the
   given theorems, or which are included among the assumptions.
