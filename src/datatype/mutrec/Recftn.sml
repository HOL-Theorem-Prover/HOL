(* In order to use our recursive theorem on mutually recursive types to
   define functions on these types, we need to be able to extract from a
   description of how the function should behave the values of the
   "return functions": the things that are universally quantified on
   the outside of the recursive theorem, which are functions and
   constants, one for each constructor of the mutually recursive types,
   that compute the return value of the function from the arguments
   of the constructor and the return values of applications of (possibly
   other) mutually recursive functions to the constructor args. We then
   instantiate our recursive function with them, define the functions,
   and prove that the definitions satisfy the desired properties. *)

(*
   In any term that defines a set of mutually recursive functions,
   there must be at most one function defined for each type (there need
   not be a function defined for every type). If a function is being
   defined on a type, the term must provide, in a sepate conjunct, a
   value for each constructor for the type, except as descibed below in
   the text reguarding the examples.

   Both examples define the same functions, a set of functions that
   count the number of variables and constructors used in a pattern. The
   first term gives explictly the values of the function on all
   constructors for each type for which a function is defined, and the
   second one uses the variable "allelse" to give the values for some of
   the constructors.  The "allelse" works like this: Say a function is
   being defined on a type (call it TY, in the second example this is
   atpat) and the case for a constructor is missing (for example,
   SCONatpat). If, following the clauses for the constructors for which
   explicit values are given (in the second example, VARatpat, CONatpat,
   EXCONatpat, RECORD2atpat, and PARatpat), there is a conjunct where the
   constructor applied to appropriate arguments (here, (SCONatpat sc)) is
   replaced by the variable "allelse" with type TY, then the value to the
   right of the = sign is used as the value of the function on terms
   constructed with that constructor. If there is a variable "arg" with
   type TY as one of the subterms of this value (the one to the right of
   the =), this will be replaced by the constructor applied to arguments
   (again, (SCONatpat sc)). There may be at most one "allelse" clause per
   function being defined, but there is no limit to the number of
   "allelse" clauses used in the term (they will be destinguished by the
   type of the variable). As noted above, the "allelse" clause must
   follow the clauses giving values for specific constructors (there need
   not be any of these).
