(*

   [prove_recordtype_thms] takes a tyinfo with the basic information
    about the type and a list of names for the record fields.  Returns
    an augmented tyinfo and a string corresponding to an ML expression
    which modifies a tyinfo in the same way as the result has just been
    modified.

   [update_tyinfo ths] transforms a tyinfo by adding the ths to it as
    extra simplification theorems. Also updates the tyinfo with
    accessor and update information.
