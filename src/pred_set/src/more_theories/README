The theories in this directory:

wellorder:
  A basic theory of well-orders. Includes an ordering relation on
  well-orders, which is itself shown to be a well-order. Also proves
  that every set can be well-ordered (using Zorn's lemma from
  set_relationTheory).

cardinal:
  A basic theory of the cardinality partial order and equivalence
  relations (≼ and ≈ respectively). Thus includes a proof that ≼ is
  anti-symmetric (Schroder-Bernstein). Also, totality of ≼ (from
  well-orderability of all sets). Finally, the important result that
  A × A ≈ A (another use of Zorn's Lemma).

ordinal:
  By quotienting the wellorders, derive a type of ordinal numbers
  (parameterised by the underlying type over which the wellorders are
  constructed). Show that this includes a copy of the natural numbers
  and a supremum operation. The latter is not always well-defined (in
  particular, you can't take a supremum of the whole type and expect
  to get back a new ordinal). Derive the standard arithmetic
  operations, define constants such as ω and ε₀, and show that all
  ordinals have a standard "polynomial" representation.
  (Also see [1] for more details.)

ucord:
  Show the existence of uncountable ordinals if the underlying type is
  big enough (itself uncountable).

ordinalNotation:
  A development of a concrete notation for ordinals up to ε₀. Based on
  the paper

     "Wellfounded induction on the ordinals up to e0".

  There is a proof of the same results in the examples/acl2/ml
  directory, but based in a theory of s-expressions.

  Some minor additions to this theory show some of the connection with
  the other presentation of ordinals.
