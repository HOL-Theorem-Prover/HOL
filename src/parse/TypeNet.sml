  (* The integer records arity of operator - this is necessary when
     types are redefined.  If the old and new versions have the
     same arity, all is well, but if they are different then the data
     structure expects the wrong thing.

     For example, if scratch$foo is of arity 1, then there will be a
     ND node beneath it (where the argument gets treated).  But if
     the user dumps that foo, and replaces it with one of arity 0, an
     attempt to follow the tree will find the node that was right before
     when it should be a leaf.

     If the user does a lot of this, the data structure will slowly fill
     up with garbage.  If a type gets replaced with a new one of the same
     arity, the data for the old type will be returned as part of a
     HOLdict.listItems when "match" is called, but the user will eliminate
     the junk with the usual sort of call to match_type.  With "peek", the
     old data won't be called because the lookup at the leaf's HOLdict
     will just find whatever's supposed to be associated with the new type.
