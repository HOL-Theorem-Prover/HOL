\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of taking a segment from a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any word of the form {WORD[b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]}, the result of evaluating
{
   WSEG_CONV "WSEG m k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0])",
}
where {m} and {k} must be numeric constants, is the theorem
{
   |- WSEG m k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]) = [b(m+k-1);...;bk]
}
The bits are indexed form the end of the list and starts
from 0.

\FAILURE
{WSEG_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above,
or {m + k} is not less than the size of the word.
