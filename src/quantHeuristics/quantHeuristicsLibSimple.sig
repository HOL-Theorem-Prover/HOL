  (* SIMPLE_QUANT_INSTANTIATE_CONV implements functionality for
     finding GAP guesses fast. Moreover, the found instantiations may
     not contain free variables. As such, the functionality is similar
     to Unwind. It allows more syntax than Unwind and can be
     extended. It is much faster than the general quantifier
     instantiations heuristics, but also far less powerful. *)

  (* A simple_guess_seaech_fun is a function that searches a guess. Given a

     - avoid : a set of variables to avoid in the instantiation
     - ty    : search a guess for either universal or existential quantification
     - v     : variable to search an instance for
     - tm    : a term to search an instantiation in

     it (if it succeeds) results in a theorem of the form

       |- SIMPLE_GUESS_EXISTS v i tm

     or

       |- SIMPLE_GUESS_FORALL v i tm

     depending on the value of ty. Moreover i does not contain any
     variable from avoid.

     Having an additional callback argument to search guesses for
     subterms is also useful. combine_sgsfwcs then allows combining a
     list of such search functions with callback into a single search
     function.

  (* to find guesses for equations, a function can also be applied to
     both sides of the equation first. For example, to find guesses
     for "x" in "(x, y) = f z" it might be useful to apply "FST" to
     both sides. This is done by "sgsfwc_eq_fun". It gets a list of
     functions to try. Entries of this list are triples containing the
     function to apply, a check when to apply and a theorem about how
     to rewrite in case the check succeeds.  For FST the entries would
     look like: (``FST``, pairSyntax.is_pair, pairTheory.FST). *)
