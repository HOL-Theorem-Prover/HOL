HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:

* OCaml >= 3.12, ocamlfind, and the OCaml package num

    As of OCalm 4.06.0, the num package is no longer part of the compiler itself,
    and must be installed separately. This can be done using e.g. OPAM:

    opam install num

* g++ >= 4.8 (with C++11 support)

Install holyhammer: (done during the build)

  run Holmake in src/holyhammer
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh/hh1
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict/mepo

Provers: Eprover(1.8 1.9 2.0), Z3 (4.0)

  Binaries with the appropriate version should be copied or linked
  in the directory src/holyhammer/provers.
  Make sure you have the permission to execute them.
  Their names should respectively be eprover and z3.

  Eprover 2.0: http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html
  Z3 4.0 (not 4.4.0): http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/

Example:

  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  holyhammer ``1 + 1 = 2``;
