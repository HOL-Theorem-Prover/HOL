HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:

* OCaml >= 3.12 (tested also with 4.01.0)
* g++ (recent version with C++11 support)
* perl

Install holyhammer:
 
  Run make in this directory.

Adding provers:
  
  Eprover with some strategy is given by default (linux 64 bit). 
  Please replace the binaries (provers/eprover/eprover) and 
  (provers/eprover/epclextract) with a version adapted to your system if needed.
  Alternatively, you can modify eprover.sh to directly call eprover/eprover losing the
  benefit of strategy scheduling done by the perl script.
    You can add the provers Z3 (4.0) and Vampire (2.6) 
  in their respective directory provers/z3 and provers/vampire. 
  You may use different versions but parsing may need to be fixed in 
  provers/prover.sh . 
    Please be aware that the name of the binary for Z3 should be z3 and 
  for Vampire it should be vampire.

Removing provers:

  Delete the associating binaries (eprover,z3 or vampire), 
  holyhammer will check that the file doesn't exists anymore and won't perform 
  premise selection and translation for this prover.

Example: 

  rlwrap bin/hol
  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  hh ``7 + 5 = 12``;
  load "complexTheory";
  hh_atp "eprover" ``0 <> 1``;
