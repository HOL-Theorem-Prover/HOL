HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.
It automatically selects suitable premises (theorems) for the current goal and
translates them together with the goal to automated theorem provers (ATPs).
The final proof is reconstructed by calling Metis on the premises appearing in
the ATP proof.

Usage (requires at least one installed external prover):
  load "holyHammer"; open holyHammer;
  hh ([],``1+1=2``);
  holyhammer ``1+1=2``; (* alternatively *)

Install external provers:
  1) Download provers
  - Eprover 2.0 (latest version should work too):
      Source: http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html
      Installing Eprover produces the binary file PROVER/eprover.
  - Z3 4.0 (only):
      Linux binary: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/
  - Vampire 4.2.2 (latest version should work too):
      Linux binary: https://vprover.github.io/download.html
      Source: https://github.com/vprover/vampire
      Installing Vampire produces the binary file "vampire_rel_master_3993"
      in the top directory.
  2) Prover binaries should be copied or linked in
     the directory src/holyhammer/provers.
     They should be respectively renamed to eprover, z3 and vampire.
  3) Make sure you have the permission to execute them (chmod +x).
