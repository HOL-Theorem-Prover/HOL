HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:

* OCaml >= 3.12 (tested also with 4.01.0)
    sudo apt-get install ocaml 
* g++ >= 4.8 (recent version with C++11 support)  
  First solution (Ubuntu):
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
  Second solution (Linux 64 bit):
    A binary is provided in src/holyhammer/predict, 
    you can simply remove the Holmake file
    from src/holyhammer/predict and relaunch the build.

Install holyhammer: (done during the build)
 
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh/hh1
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict

Adding provers:
  
  Eprover and Z3 are given by default for linux 64 bit. 
  Please replace the binary provers/eprover/eprover
  You can add the provers Z3 (4.0) and Vampire (2.6) 
  in their respective directory. 
  You may use different versions but parsing may need to be fixed in 
  provers/"prover".sh . 
  The name of the binary for Z3 should be z3 and 
  for Vampire it should be vampire.

Modifying the time out and other ATP specific parameters: 
  
  Change the scripts provers/"prover".sh.
  You do not need to restart hol4.

Removing provers:

  Delete the binaries (eprover,z3 or vampire) in
  their respective directory provers/"prover".

Example: 

  rlwrap bin/hol
  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  hh [] ``1 + 1 = 2``;
  METIS_PROVE lemmas ``1 + 1 = 2``; 
  load "complexTheory";
  hh_atp [] "eprover" ``0 <> 1``;
