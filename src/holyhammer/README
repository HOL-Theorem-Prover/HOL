HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Install Holyhammer:
  
  Run Holmake in src/holyhammer (done during the build)

Install external provers: Eprover(1.8 1.9 2.0, latest version should work too), 
  Z3 (4.0), Vampire (4.2.2)

  1) Download provers 
  - Eprover 2.0: 
      Source: http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html
        (eprover binary found in PROVER directory)
  - Z3 4.0 (not 4.4.0): 
      Binaries: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/

      Linux binary: https://vprover.github.io/download.html
      Source: https://github.com/vprover/vampire 
        (produces vampire_rel_master_3993 in the top directory)
  2) Prover binaries with the appropriate version should be copied or linked
     in the directory src/holyhammer/provers.
     They should be respectively renamed to eprover, z3 and vampire.
