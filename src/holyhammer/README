HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:
* OCaml >= 3.12 (tested also with 4.01.0)
* g++ (recent version with C++11 support)
* perl

Install: See INSTALL file in the main directory. 
  Here is a short version:
  Getting polyml:
    Download the latest version of polyml (http://www.polyml.org/). 
    ./configure --enable-shared (instead of ./configure)
    make
    make install
    Add polyml to your .bashrc path. (example: PATH=$PATH:$HOME/polyml.5.5.2)
  In the HOL directory:
    poly < tools/smart-configure.sml
    bin/build

Fixing the binaries and adding more provers (optional):
  
  Eprover with some strategy is given by default (linux 64 bit). 
  Please replace the binaries (provers/eprover/eprover) and 
  (provers/eprover/epclextract) with a version adapted to your system if needed.
  Alternatively, you can modify eprover.sh to directly call eprover/eprover losing the
  benefit of startegy scheduling done by the perl script.
 
  You can add the provers Z3 (4.0) and Vampire (2.6) 
  in their respective directory provers/z3 and provers/vampire. 
  You may use different versions but parsing may need to be fixed in 
  provers/prover.sh . 

  Please be aware that the name of the binary for Z3 should be z3 and 
  for Vampire it should be vampire.

Examples: rlwrap bin/hol
  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  holyhammer ``0 < 1``;
  load "complexTheory";
  holyhammer ``0 <> 1``;
