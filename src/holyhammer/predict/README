The format of machine learning data is as follows:

"seq" gives the order of all the named facts, one by line.
"eval" gives the facts to find predictions for (no definitions or basic tautologies), one per line.
"deps" gives the dependencies used in a proof. Only available for some (provable) facts. Each line is:
  theorema: lemmab lemmab lemmac
"syms" gives the features present in each fact. If not present assumed empty. Each line is:
  lemmad:"featurebla", "feature asd, asd", "a,d,eff "

However we would like to change the "seq" in the long run to give an accessibility relation.
