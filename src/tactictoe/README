TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces. 

RECORDING:
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes a long time (2-12h) *)

USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;

CLEANING: 
  - TacticToe calls depends on the data stored in 
    src/tactictoe/ttt_tacdata 
  - TacticToe recording and evaluation depends on data stored in 
    src/AI/sml_inspection/open
  After updating HOL, it is usually necessary to 
  remove these directories and start afresh 

EXAMPLE: see examples in src/tactictoe/examples.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
  Keep up-to-date: infix tokens in tttInfix.sml, polyml values in tttUnfold.sml.
