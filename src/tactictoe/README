TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces. 

WARNING: Recording has been tested on core theories. 
  Recording of latter theories might fail.

RECORDING:
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_record ();

RECORDING (only one theory):
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  ttt_rewrite_thy "foo";
  ttt_record_thy "foo";

USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  ttt ([],``1+1=2``);

CLEANING: 
  - TacticToe calls depends on the data stored in 
    src/tactictoe/ttt_tacdata.
  - TacticToe recording and evaluation depends on data stored in
    src/AI/sml_inspection/open
  After updating HOL, it is usually necessary to 
  remove these directories and start afresh.

EXAMPLE: see examples in src/tactictoe/examples.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
  Keep up-to-date: 
  - core theories in src/AI/sml_inspection/smlOpen.sml
  - infix tokens in src/tactictoe/src/tttInfix.sml, 
  - polyml values in src/tactictoe/src/tttUnfold.sml.
  Debugging directories:
  - Output of the modified theory foo is can be found in 
    src/AI/sml_inspection/buildheap/build_fooScript_ttt
    Thm.dest_thm is expected intentionnaly to output errors.
  - A copy of the modified theory is saved under src/tactictoe/scripts
    for further inspection.
  - The src/tactictoe/debug directory might contain more information.
