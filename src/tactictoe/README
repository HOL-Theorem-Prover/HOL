TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces.

SKIPPING RECORDING of the HOL4 standard library:
  1) Download the file ttt_tacdata_kananaskis-14.tar.gz from
     http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~thibault/
  2) Extract it in your HOL/src/tactictoe directory.
     This creates the directory HOL/src/tactictoe/ttt_tacdata.

RECORDING all ancestor theories not recorded yet:
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes about 8 hours for the full standard library *)
  (* tip: use ttt_record_thy "foo" to only record the "foo" Theory *)

USAGE (after RECORDING or SKIPPING RECORDING):
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  ttt ([],``1+1=2``);
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``; (* alternatively *)

CLEANING:
  TacticToe depends on data stored in src/tactictoe/ttt_tacdata and
  src/AI/sml_inspection/open.
  It is usually necessary to remove these directories before re-recording.
  This can be done by calling tttUnfold.ttt_clean_record ().

EXAMPLE: see examples in src/tactictoe/examples.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
  Keep up-to-date:
  1) core theories in src/AI/sml_inspection/smlOpen.sml
  2) infix tokens in src/tactictoe/src/tttInfix.sml,
  3) polyml values in src/tactictoe/src/tttUnfold.sml.
  Debugging directories:
  1) Output of the modified theory foo is can be found in
     src/AI/sml_inspection/buildheap/buildheap_fooScript_ttt.
     Set aiLib.debug_flag and to true or/and smlRedirect.hide_flag to false
     for more output.
  2) A copy of the modified theory is saved under src/tactictoe/scripts
     for further inspection.

WARNING: Recording has been tested only on core theories.
