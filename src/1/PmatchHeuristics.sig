      takes the column-number from the provided list of explicit
      choices. If the list is too short, the first column is
      chosen. One should run this heuristic first with an empty list
      as argument. Then look at the choices and add 0s for all the
      initial choices you liked to be 0 an then a different choice you
      prefer. Rerun again (because the following choices will change)
      and iterate. This provided very fine control, but is tedious. *)

      c_ik. It then picks column i such that [c_1i, ... c_ji] is maximal
      accroding to the lexicographic ordering of integers.

      Heu_fun initialises the functions and returns a compare function
      and a function heu_fun' which provides heuristics. As long as
      heu_fun' () provides fresh heuristics these are tried. Then the
      best result of all these heuristics according to the compare
      function is choosen. *)
