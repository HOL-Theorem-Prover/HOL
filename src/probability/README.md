# HOL's Probability Theory

This directory contains HOL4's Measure, Lebesgue Integration and Probability theories.

## Preliminaries

     util_probScript.sml          * Utility lemmas needed by other scripts
     extrealScript.sml            * The theory of extended reals

## Measure, Integration and Probability Theory defined on extended reals

     sigma_algebraScript.sml      * Sigma-algebra and other systems of sets
     real_borelScript.sml         * Borel-measurable sets generated from reals
     measureScript.sml            * Measure Theory defined on extended reals
     borelScript.sml              * Borel sets and Borel measurable functions
     lebesgueScript.sml           * Lebesgue integration based on extended reals
     martingaleScript.sml         * Martingales based on Ïƒ-finite filtered measure space
     probabilityScript.sml        * Probability Theory based on extended reals

## Measure, Integration and Probability Theory defined on reals (obsoleted)

     NOTE: The legacy measure, integration and probability theories based on finite measures
     are moved to `$(HOLDIR)/examples/probability/legacy`. They are needed when building the
     two examples in `examples/miller` and `examples/diningcryptos`.

## Further extensions

     See `$(HOLDIR)/examples/probability`.
