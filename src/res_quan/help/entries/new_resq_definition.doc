\TYPE {new_resq_definition : ((string # term) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declare a new constant and install a definitional axiom in the current theory.

\KEYWORDS
definition, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_resq_definition} provides a facility for definitional
extensions to the current theory. The new constant defined using this
function may take arguments which are restricted quantified.  The
function {new_resq_definition} takes a pair argument consisting 
of the name under which the resulting definition will be saved
in the current theory segment, and a term giving the desired definition.  The
value returned by {new_resq_definition} is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.

Let {x_1,...,x_n} be distinct variables.  Evaluating
{
   new_resq_definition (`name`,
    "!x_i::P_i. ... !x_j::P_j. C x_1 ... x_n = t")
} 
where {C} is not already a constant, {i} is greater or equal to 1 and
{i <= j <= n}, declares {C} to be a new constant in the current theory
with this definition as its specification. 
This constant specification is returned as a theorem with the form
{
   |- !x_i::P_i. ... !x_j::P_j. !x_k .... C x_1 ... x_n = t
}
where the variables {x_k} are the free variables occurring on
the left hand side of the definition and are not restricted
quantified. This theorem is saved in the current theory under
(the name) {name}. 

If the restricting predicates {P_l} contains free occurrence of
variable(s) of the left hand side, the constant {C} will stand for a
family of functions.


\FAILURE
{new_resq_definition} fails if called when HOL is not in draft mode.  It also
fails if there is already an axiom, definition or specification of the given
name in the current theory segment; if {`C`} is already a constant in the
current theory or is not an allowed name for a constant; if {t} contains free
variables that do not occur in the left hand side, or if
any variable occurs more than once in {x_1, ..., x_n}.  Finally, failure occurs
if there is a type variable in {x_1}, ..., {x_n} or {t} that does not occur in
the type of {C}.

\EXAMPLE
A function for indexing list elements starting from 1 can be defined as follows:
{
   #new_resq_definition (`EL1_DEF`,
   # "!n:: (\k. 0 < k). EL1 n (l:* list) = EL (n - 1) l");;
   |- !n :: \k. 0 < k. !l. EL1 n l = EL(n - 1)l
}
The following example shows how a family of constants may be defined
if the restricting predicate involves free variable on the left hand
side of the definition.
{
   #new_resq_definition (`ELL_DEF`,
   # "!n:: (\k. k < (LENGTH l)). ELL n (l:* list) = EL n  l");;
   |- !l. !n :: \k. k < (LENGTH l). !l'. ELL l n l' = EL n l'
}
