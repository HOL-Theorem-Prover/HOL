\DOC RESQ_HALF_EXISTS

\TYPE {RESQ_HALF_EXISTS : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Strip a restricted existential quantification from the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- ?x::P. t}, {RESQ_HALF_EXISTS} returns
the theorem
{
   A |- ?x. P x /\ t
}
i.e., it transforms the restricted existential
quantification to its underlying semantic representation.
{
      A |- ?x::P. t
   --------------------  RESQ_HALF_EXISTS
    A |- ?x. P x ==> t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a restricted existential quantification.
