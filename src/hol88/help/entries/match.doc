\TYPE {match : term -> term -> ((term * term) list * (hol_type * hol_type) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Finds instantiations to match one term to another.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two terms, {match_term} attempts to find a set of type and term
instantiations for the first term (only) to make it equal the second. If it 
succeeds, it returns the instantiations in the form of a pair containing a
term substitution and a type substitution. If the first term represents the
conclusion of a theorem, the returned instantiations are of the appropriate 
form to be passed to {INST_TY_TERM}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term cannot be matched by one-way instantiation. It is also not 
apt to be useful unless {Old_syntax} is open, since the substitutions that 
{match} produces are not of the right type for the hol90 routines that use
substitutions, like {subst} for instance.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how {match_term} could be used to match the conclusion of a
theorem to a term.
{
   - val th = REFL (--`x:'a`--);
   th = |- x = x

   - match (concl th) (--`1 = 1`--);
   val it = ([((--`1`--),(--`x`--))],
             [((==`:num`==),(==`:'a`==))])
     : term subst * hol_type subst

  - INST_TY_TERM it th;
   |- 1 = 1
}

\COMMENTS
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned instantiations will be
possible for {INST_TY_TERM} to achieve, because some of the variables (term or
type) which need to be instantiated may be free in the assumptions, eg:
{
   - (show_types := true; show_assums := true);
   () : unit

   - val th = ASSUME (--`x:'a = x`--);
   val th = [(x :'a) = (x :'a)] |- (x :'a) = (x :'a) : thm

   - match_term (concl th) (--`1 = 1`--);
   val it = ([((--`1`--),(--`x`--))],
             [((==`:num`==),(==`:'a`==))])
     : term subst * hol_type subst

   - Old_syntax.INST_TY_TERM it th handle e => Raise e;
   Exception raised at Thm.INST_TYPE:
   type variable(s) in assumptions would be instantiated in concl

}
In fact, for instantiating a theorem, {PART_MATCH} is usually easier.

Why is {match} in {hol88Lib}? Because {match} is not provided in
hol90; the more accurate name {match_term} is used. Also, hol90
provides {match_type}.
