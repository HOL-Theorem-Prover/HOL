\TYPE {inst_type : (hol_type * hol_type) list -> hol_type -> hol_type}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates types in a type.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. If {[(t1',t1),...,(tn',tn)]} is a list of
type instantiations, where {t1...tn} are the initial types, and
{t1'...tn'} the desired instantiations, and {ty} is a type to
instantiate, the call
{
   inst_type [(t1',t1),...,(tn',tn)] ty
}
will appropriately instantiate the type {ty}. The
instantiations will be performed in parallel. If several of the type
instantiations are applicable, the choice is undefined. The {t1...tn}
need not be type variables, but those that aren't will not be
substituted for. Neither is it necessary that any or all of the types
{t1...tn} should in fact appear in {ty}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - inst_type [((==`:bool`==),(==`:'a`==))] (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type

  - inst_type [((==`:num`==),(==`:'a # 'b`==)),((==`:bool`==),(==`:'a`==))]
              (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type

}

\COMMENTS
Not in hol90, since the author decided that {type_subst} was a better name.
{inst_type} and {type_subst} have different types, but modulo that, they
perform identically.
{
    - type_subst;
    val it = fn : hol_type subst -> hol_type -> hol_type
}
