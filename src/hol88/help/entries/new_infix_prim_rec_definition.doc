\TYPE {new_infix_prim_rec_definition : (string * term) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Defines an infix primitive recursive function over the type {num}.

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_infix_prim_rec_definition} provides the facility for defining
primitive recursive functions with infix status on the type {num}. It takes a
pair argument, consisting of the name under which the resulting definition will
be saved in the current theory segment, and a term giving the desired
definition.  The value returned by {new_infix_prim_rec_definition} is a theorem
which states the definition requested by the user.  This theorem is derived by
formal proof from an instance of the theorem {num_Axiom}:
{
   |- !e f. ?! fn. (fn 0 = e) /\ (!n. fn(SUC n) = f(fn n)n)
}
Evaluating
{
   new_infix_prim_rec_definition
    ("fun_DEF",
     (--`(fun 0 x = f_1[x]) /\
         (fun (SUC n) x = f_2[fun n x', n, x])`--));;
}
where all the free variables in the term {x'} are
contained in {{{n, x}}}, automatically proves the theorem:
{
   |-  ?fun. !x. fun 0 x = f_1[x] /\
             !x. fun (SUC n) x = f_2[fun n x', n, x]
}
and then declares a new constant {fun} with this property and infix
status as its specification. This constant specification is returned as a
theorem and is saved with name {fun_DEF} in the current theory segment.

The ML function {new_infix_prim_rec_definition} is, in fact, slightly more
general than is indicated above.  In particular, a curried primitive recursive
function can be defined by primitive recursion on either one of its arguments
using this ML function.  The ML function {new_infix_prim_rec_definition} also
allows the user to partially specify the value of a function defined (possibly
recursively) on the natural numbers by giving its value for only one of {0} or
{SUC n}.

\FAILURE
Failure occurs if HOL cannot prove there is a function satisfying the
specification (ie. if the term supplied to {new_prim_rec_definition} is not a
well-formed primitive recursive definition); if the type of {fun} is not of the
form {ty_1->ty_2->ty_3}, or if any other condition for making a constant
specification is violated (see the failure conditions for {new_specification}).

\EXAMPLE
Here is the recursive definition of the constant {+} used by the system:
{
   new_infix_prim_rec_definition
    ("ADD",
     (--`($+ 0 n = n) /\
         ($+ (SUC m) n = SUC($+ m n))`--))
}
The {$}'s are there (as documentation) to indicate that the constant
{+} is being declared to be an infix.  Evaluating this ML expression will
create the following constant specification in the current theory segment:
{
   ADD = |- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n))
}
