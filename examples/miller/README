This example is a verification of the Miller-Rabin probabilistic [1]
primality test, incorporating some cute example probabilistic programs.

The most convenient way to build it is change to the examples/miller/miller
directory, and use Holmake.  This will build the dependent directories in the example as necessary.

It does build RIGHT NOW, but is quite sensitive to changes in the HOL
proof tools. I'll try and support it (especially if anyone uses it),
but sadly it might become more trouble than it's worth.
