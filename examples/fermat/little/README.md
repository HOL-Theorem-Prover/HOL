These scripts contain theories to support the formalisation of Fermat's Little Theorem. This is the source code for the paper `A String of Pearls: Proofs of Fermat's Little Theorem`, with [DOI: 10.6092/issn.1972-5787/3728](https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.1972-5787/3728) or [journal](https://jfr.unibo.it/article/view/3728).

## Theory
* __necklace__, necklaces and colours.
* __cycle__, cycle on lists.
* __pattern__, cycle period and order.

## Application
* __FLTbinomial__, number-theoretic proof using binomial expansion of prime exponent.
* __FLTnumber__, using modular arithmetic, without explicit group.
* __FLTgroup__, group-theoretic proof using multiplicative group of modulo prime.
* __FLTeuler__, group-theoretic proof using multiplicative group of coprimes.
* __FLTnecklace__, using necklace cycles and patterns.
* __FLTaction__, using group action on necklaces.
* __FLTfixedpoint__, using fixed points of group action on necklaces.
* __FLTpetersen__, the original Petersen's proof, line-by-line.
