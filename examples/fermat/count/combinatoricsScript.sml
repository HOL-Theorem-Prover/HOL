(* The strategy:
This is to show, ultimately, C(n,k) = binomial n k.

Conceptually,
C(n,k) = number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
Each choice gives a k-subset.

Define C(n,k) = number of k-subsets of an n-set.
Prove that C(n,k) = binomial n k:
(1) C(0,0) = 1
(2) C(0,1) = 0
(3) C(SUC n, SUC k) = C(n,k) + C(n,SUC k)
show that any such C's is just the binomial function.

binomial_alt
|- !n k. binomial n 0 = 1 /\ binomial 0 (k + 1) = 0 /\
         binomial (n + 1) (k + 1) = binomial n k + binomial n (k + 1)

Moreover, bij_eq is an equivalence relation, and partitions the power set
of (count n) into equivalence classes of k-subsets for k = 0 to n. Thus

SUM (GENLIST (choose n) (SUC n)) = CARD (POW (count n)) = 2 ** n

the counterpart of binomial_sum |- !n. SUM (GENLIST (binomial n) (SUC n)) = 2 ** n

(* Historical note.
This use of interleave to list all permutations is called
the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm, due to re-discovery by various people.
Outside mathematics, this method was known already to 17th-century English change ringers.
Equivalently, this algorithm finds a Hamiltonian cycle in the permutohedron.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter_algorithm

1677 A book by Fabian Stedman lists the solutions for up to six bells.
1958 A book by Steinhaus describes a related puzzle of generating all permutations by a system of particles.
Selmer M. Johnson and Hale F. Trotter discovered the algorithm independently of each other in the early 1960s.

(* Proof:
   Let R = feq set,

       t = sub_count n k.
   Then FINITE s                 by list_count_finite

                                 by list_count_set_partititon_element_card
   Thus CARD s = perm k * CARD (partition R s)

   Note CARD s = n arrange k     by arrange_def
