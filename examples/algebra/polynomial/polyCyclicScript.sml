(* Notes:

   Basically, cyclic n = (unity n) / (unity 1)
   provides a simple way to show that (unity n) has #1 as a simple root, multiplicity = 1.
   This is because, clearly, #1 is not a root of cyclic n = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^(n-1).

   Let F be a Finite Field, with n = |F|.
   In its polynomial ring F[x], this is called the Master Polynomial:

   x^n - x = x (x^n - 1) = x (x - 1)(x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) + .... + 1)

   This Master Polynomial has the following property:
   !x. x IN F <=> x is a root of Master Polynomial.

   That is, !x. x IN F <=> eval (x^n - x) x = 0

   By restricting n = |F|, it holds for primes, and powers of primes.
   This Master Polynomial plays a role in the proof that F* is cyclic.

   However, the algebraic identity is just geometric series, hence applies for general n.

   Specifically, this is called the Cyclic Polynomial:

   (x^n - 1) = (x - 1)(x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) + .... + 1)

   The roots of (x^n - 1) are called the roots of unity.

   Example: x^4 - 1 = (x-1)(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2 + 1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x-i)(x+i)

   When F = C, complex numbers, x^4 - 1 in C[x] has 4 roots: 1, -1, i, -i.
                                and order 1 = 1, order -1 = 2, order i = 4 = order -i.
   When F = GF(2), booleans, x^4 - 1 in GF(2)[x] has 2 roots: 1 = -1 (repeated),
                                and order 1 = 1 = order (-1)
   When F = Zp, p = odd prime, x^4 -1 in Zp[x] has 2 roots: 1, -1 (distinct),
                                and order 1 = 1, order -1 = 2

   Let z = an n-th root of unity.
   By definition, z^n = 1, hence divides (order z) n   by group_order_divides
   If (order z) = n, z is called a primitive n-th root unity.

   Let uroots n = {z | z IN F /\ z^n = 1}.
   Then  (uroots n) <= F*

   If F* is cyclic, (uroots n) is also cyclic     by cyclic_uroots_cyclic
   We do know that F* is cyclic                   by finite_field_mult_group_cyclic
   So (uroots n) is cyclic, or there is always a primitive n-th root of unity.

   Let q = primitive n-th root of unity.
   By definition, q^n = 1, and (order q) = n.

   Thus q is a root of the Cyclic Polynomial.
   If 1 < n, q <> 1, hence q^(n-1) + q^(n-2) + ... + 1 = 0
   Since (order q) = n, its powers q, q^2, q^3, ...., q^(n-1), q^n = 1 gives n distinct n-th roots of unity.

   Also, x^n - 1 has an irreducible factor h     by irreducible_factor_exists (almost)
   i.e. x^n - 1 = k(x)h(x)
   so   0 = q^n - 1 = k(q)h(q)
   We need somehow to conclude: There is an irreducible factor h with q as a root.

   So far, I can only show: there is an irreducible factor h with X as a root.

   Some say: X = q mod h. Can this be proved???

   If n is prime, then X is a primitive n-th root of unity, by the following:
   For any polynomial modulo h, (lift h) has X as root, by poly_mod_has_root_X.
   and X in F[x] mod h.
   By lifting,  (lift x^n-1)(X) = (lift k)(lift h)(X)
                                = (lift k)(X) * (lift h)(X)
                                = (lift k)(X) * |0|
                                = |0|
   Hence X is an n-th root of (lift x^n-1), or X^n = |1|.
   Therefore  (order X) divides n    by group_order_condition.
   If n is prime, (order X) = 1, or (order X) = n.
   (order X) = 1  iff X = |1|        by group_order_eq_1
   If X = 1, X^(n-1) + X^(n-2) + ... + |1| = |0| means (n-1) * |1| = |0|, which is impossible.
   Hence X <> 1, or (order X) <> 1, i.e. (order X) = n, or X is a primitive n-th root.

   If n is not prime, say n = pq, there is an identity:
   x^n - 1 = x^pq - 1 = (x^p(q-1)+ x^p(q-2)+ ... + 1)(x^p- 1)

   But don't know how to make use of this identity.

(* Notes:
   Theory of Cyclotomic Polynomials:
   Cyclotomic polynomials are the irreducible factors of Cyclic polynomial:

   x^n - 1 = PROD polyPhi(d), over all divides d n.

   and polyPhi(n) = PROD (x - e^(i 2pi k/n)), over all coprime k n.
                  = minimal polynomial in Q[z], where z is a primitive root of unity (e.g. e^(i 2pi k/n)).
                  = PROD (x^(n/d) - 1)^mu(d), over all divides d n (by Mobius Inversion)
                  = PROD (x^d - 1)^mu(n/d), over all divides d n (again by Mobius Inversion)

   Examples:
   x^1 - 1 = (x-1) = polyPhi(1)
   x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(2)
   x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(3)
   x^4 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(2)polyPhi(4)
   x^5 - 1 = (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(5)
   x^6 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(2)polyPhi(3)polyPhi(6)
   x^7 - 1 = (x-1)(x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1) = polyPhi(1)polyPhi(7)

   polyPhi(1) = (x-1)^1 = x-1
   polyPhi(2) = (x^2-1)^1(x-1)^-1 = x+1
   polyPhi(3) = (x^3-1)^1(x-1)^-1 = x^2+x+1
   polyPhi(4) = (x^4-1)^1(x^2-1)^-1 = x^2+1
   polyPhi(5) = (x^5-1)^1(x-1)^-1 = x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1
   polyPhi(6) = (x^5-1)^1(x^3-1)^-1(x^2-1)^-1(x-1)^1 = x^2-x+1
   polyPhi(7) = (x^7-1)^1(x-1)^-1 = x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1

   The irreducibility of polyPhi(n) where n is prime follows by Eisenstein's criterion.
   The degree of polyPhi(n) = phi(n) = number of k coprime to n.
   For prime n, phi(n) = n-1,
   and deg polyPhi(n) = deg (x^(n-1)+x^(n-2)+...+x+1) = n-1.

(* Theorem: For a Field F, its multiplicative group F* is cyclic.

By Cyclic defintion, need to show that Group F* has a generator.
By cyclic_finite_alt, just need to show: Group F* has an element with order = size of group.

The strategy is this:
* Go through all elements, and note its order.
* There must be a maximal order m, and an element z with ord z = m.
* Show that m <= n, where n = |F*|
* Show that n <= m, hence m = n, and Group F* has generator z.

The proof of m <= n is group-theoretic:
   Given a FiniteGroup F*, let n = |F*|, m = maximal order in F*.
   Let z be the element attaining the maximal order m.
   Then <z> <= F*, hence m = |<z>| <= |F*| = n, or m <= n.

The proof of n <= m is a mix of group order and polynomial roots:
   For any element x in F*,
   Let order of x = p, then p divides m,  by group_order_divides_maximal
   That is, m = pq, and x is a root of the polynomial x^m-#1 in F[x]:
     x^m = x^(pq)
         = (x^p)^q      by group_exp_mult
         = #1^q         by group_order_property
         = #1           by group_id_exp

   Hence the polynomial x^m - |1| in F[x] has n roots in F,
   but its degree is m, thus n <= m    by poly_roots_count.

This proof is in: ffAdvancedTheory.finite_field_mult_group_cyclic
*)

(* Can this reasoning be applied to show:
   * (uroots n) <= g                      by group_uroots_subgroup
   * There is a primitive in (uroots n)   by cyclic_uroots_has_primitive
   * This is a primitive root of x ** n - #1,
     or there are n roots in (uroots n) ?

   Seems the best thing is this:
   cyclic_uroots_has_primitive  |- !g. FINITE G /\ cyclic g ==>
                                   !n. ?z. z IN (uroots n).carrier /\ (ord z = CARD (uroots n).carrier)

   Given a Field F, for any n, what about the roots of x^n - |1| ?

   If n = CARD |F*| = CARD |F| - 1, all x IN R+ are roots.
   If n < CARD |F*|,
   If n > CARD |F*|,

   Example:
   Let F = Zp where p = 2. CARD |F*| = 1.
   x^1 - 1  has 1 root: (1)^1 - 1 = 0 (splitting field).
   x^2 - 1  has 1 root: (1)^2 - 1 = 0.

   Let F = Zp where p = 3. CARD |F*| = 2.
   x^1 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^1 - 1 = 0, (2)^1 - 1 = 1 <> 0.
   x^2 - 1  has 2 roots: (1)^2 - 1 = 0, (2)^2 - 1 = 3 = 0 = (-1)^2 - 1 (splitting field).
   x^3 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^3 - 1 = 0, (2)^3 - 1 = 7 <> 0.
   x^4 - 1  has 2 roots: (1)^4 - 1 = 0, (2)^4 - 1 = 15 = 0 = (-1)^4 - 1.

   Let F = GF4 = {0, 1, b, t}, where b + t = 1, b * t = 1. CARD |F*| = 3.
   x^1 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^1 - 1 = 0.
   x^2 - 1  has 2 root:  (1)^2 - 1 = 0, but -1 = 1, hence repeated.
   x^3 - 1  has 3 roots: (1)^3 - 1 = 0, b^3 - 1 = 0, t^3 - 1 = 0 (splitting field).
   x^4 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^4 - 1 = 0.
   x^5 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^5 - 1 = 0.

   Note: GF4 = {0, 1, x, 1+x}, with x + (1+x) = 1, x(1+x) = 1

  +    0   1     x  1+x        0 1     x 1+x
  0    0   1     x  1+x    0   0 0     0   0
  1    1   0   1+x    x    1   0 1     x 1+x
  i      x 1+x   0    1      x 0   x 1+x 1
  1+x  1+x   x   1    0    1+x 0 1+x 1     x
  i.e. in GF4, x*x = 1 + x <> -1.

   Let F = Zp where p = 5. CARD |F*| = 4.
   x^1 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^1 - 1 = 0.
   x^2 - 1  has 2 roots: (1)^2 - 1 = 0, -1 = 4, (4)^2 - 1 = 15 = 0.
   x^3 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^3 - 1 = 0.
   x^4 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^4 - 1 = 0.
   x^5 - 1  has 5 roots: (1)^5 - 1 = 0, (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1) = 0.
   x^6 - 1  has 1 root:  (1)^6 - 1 = 0.

   The number of n-th roots equals gcd(n, CARD |F*|).

   The multiplicative group of F* is cyclic, let g be a generator.
   For an element x of the group x^n=1 holds iff x=g^m with nm divisible by CARD |F*|.
   The latter is equivalent to m divisible by (CARD |F*|)/d, where d := gcd(n, CARD |F*|),
   hence the n-th roots of unity form the subgroup generated by g^(CARD |F*|)/d.
   This subgroup clearly has d elements, so the number of n-th roots equals gcd(n, CARD |F*|).

While cyclotomic polynomial are irreducible over Q, not all of them are irreducible
when considered as a polynomial over a finite field. For example, over F_2, the
7-th cyclotomic polynomial phi_7 = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 factors into
two factors of degree 3: phi_7 = (x^3 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1) in F_2.

One can show that the cyclotomic polynomial phi_n is irreducible over F_p precisely
when p has multiplicative order phi(n) modulo n. This follows from the theory of
cyclotomic extension of Q.

In particular, if (Z/nZ)* is not cyclic (i.e. unless n is an odd prime, twice an odd prime,
or n = 2 or 4), then phi_n is reducible module every prime p, despite being irreducible over Q.
*)

(*
Observe that the polynomial x^k - 1 over Z_m[x], with 1 < m:

For 0 < k,  x^k - 1 = (x - 1)(x^(k-1) + ... + x + 1)

This equation holds for any Ring r with #1 <> #0.

Whether and how the cofactor of (x - 1) splits into factors depends on k and m.
Focus on the case where k, m = p are different primes.

p = 11, k = 5: In Z_11[x], x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x + 8)(x + 7)(x + 6)(x + 2) -- linear factors
p = 11, k = 7: In Z_11[x], x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x + 10)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 6x + 10) -- irreducible pair
p =  7, k = 5: In  Z_7[x], x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible.

Why, because by 7.6.2 (below), the crucial parameter is order_k(p)

p = 11, k = 5, order_5(11) = order_5(11 MOD 5) = order_5(1) = 1, hence factors of degree 1.
p = 11, k = 7, order_7(11) = order_7(11 MOD 7) = order_7(4) = 3, hence factors of degree 3.
p =  7, k = 5, order_5(7) = order_5(7 MOD 5) = order_5(2) = 4, hence factors of degree 4.

-- Therefore, while PHI(prime k) is irreducible in Z[x], PHI(prime k) may/maynot be irreducible in Z_p[x].

Theorem (7.4.6): Let F' = F[x]/(h). Then e = (X % h) IN F' is a root of h, i.e. h(e) = 0 IN F'.
Note: If 1 < deg h, then e = X IN (F' - F).
      If deg h = 1, then h = X + a for some a IN F, and e = -a.
      by (7.3.3) for modulo calculation.
This is poly_mod_ring_has_root_X  |- !r z. Ring r /\ ulead z ==> (peval z X % z = |0|)
or poly_field_lift_mod_has_root_X |- !r. Field r ==> !z. poly z /\ 1 < deg z ==> rootz (lift z) X

Theorem (7.6.2): Let prime p and prime r and p <> r.
Let h = a monic irreducible factor of (X^k - 1) DIV (X - 1), which exists by 7.4.4 (Unique Factorization)
Then in the Field F = Z_p[x]/(h), the element e = (X % h) satisfies order_F(e) = k.
Proof:
Let X^k - 1 = (X - 1) * h * q
e = X % h is a root of h in F, by 7.4.6, i.e. h(e) = 0.
so e is also a root of the product h * q, and the entire product (X - 1) * h * q.
Thus (1) e^(k-1) + ... + e + 1 = 0   by (h * q)(e) = 0
 and (2) e^k - 1 = 0, or e^k = 1     by ((X - 1) * h * q)(e) = 0
From (2), order_F(e) divides k.
But prime k, so order_F(e) = 1, or order_F(e) = k.
But order_F(e) = 1 <=> e = 1      by group_order_eq_1
If e = 1, (1) gives: 1^(k-1) + ... + 1 + 1 = 0, or k = 0 (mod p), which is impossible as prime k <> p.
Therefore order_F(e) = k.

Factorization of Cyclic Polynomials in Finite Field

Then X^n - |1| = (X - |1|) * (cyclic n)

The Factorization of (cyclic n) when considered as element of R[x] is the focus here.

Should be simple to show:
cyclic 0 = [] = |0|, and X^0 - |1| = |0|, or X^0 = |1|.
cyclic 1 = [#1] = |1|, and X^1 - |1| = (X - |1|). cyclic 1 is trivially irreducible.
cyclic 2 = [#1;#1] = X + |1|, and X^2 - |1| = (X - |1|)(X + |1|). cyclic 2 is (also) trivially determine.

After this, there is no generic factorization.

p =  7, k = 5: In  Z_7[x], x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible.

Why, because by 7.6.2 (below), the crucial parameter is order_k(p)

p = 11, k = 5, order_5(11) = order_5(11 MOD 5) = order_5(1) = 1, hence factors of degree 1.
p = 11, k = 7, order_7(11) = order_7(11 MOD 7) = order_7(4) = 3, hence factors of degree 3.
p =  7, k = 5, order_5(7) = order_5(7 MOD 5) = order_5(2) = 4, hence factors of degree 4.
