(* If X is replaced by primitive k-th root of unity, what changes are required?
   The road seems block because so far:

       or x = #0                              by field_exp_eq_zero, PRE n <> 0
    Also, eval (diff (unity n)) #0
        = ##n * #0 ** PRE n = #0              by above, ring_zero_exp, PRE n <> 0
    Hence root (diff (unity n) #0             by poly_root_def
