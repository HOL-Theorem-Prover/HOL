A polynomial is a list of coefficients taken from a ring or a field.

## Theory
* __polynomial__, definition and basic properties.
* __polyWeak__, raw polynomials: not normalised, may have leading zero.
* __polyRing__, polynomials with coefficients from a ring.
* __polyField__, polynomials with coefficients from a field.
* __polyDivision__, polynomial Division with quotient and remainder.
* __polyModuloRing__, polynomial quotient ring by a modulus.
* __polyMonic__, monic Polynomials, those with leading coefficient equals one.
* __polyFieldDivision__, division of field polynomials, any nonzero polynomial can be a divisor.
* __polyRoot__, polynomial factors and roots.
* __polyEval__, polynomial evaluation, acting as a function.
* __polyDerivative__,formal derivative for polynomials, symbolic term by term.

## Application
* __polyBinomial__, polynomial binomial expansion formula.
* __polyDivides__, polynomial divisibility, relation to vanishing of remainder.
* __polyRingModulo__, ring polynomial remainder congruences.
* __polyProduct__, product of polynomials, properties, evaluation, and divisibility.
* __polyIrreducible__, irreducible polynomials, those without proper factors.
* __polyCyclic__, properties of cyclic polynomial: quotient of (x^n - 1) by (x - 1).
* __polyFieldModulo__, field polynomial remainder congruences.
* __polyGCD__, greatest common divisor of polynomials.
