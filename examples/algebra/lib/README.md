These scripts develop basic theories to support various libraries.

## Enhancement
* __helperNum__, more theorems on parity, divisibility, inequalities, `MAX` and `MIN`.
* __helperSet__, more theormes on function images, `SUM_SET` and `PROD_SET`.
* __helperList__, enhance listTheory with `SUM`, `PROD`, `MAX_LIST`, `MIN_LIST`, `rotate`, and `turn`.
* __helperFunction__, collect theorems for integer functions: `SQRT`, `ROOT`, `FACT`, `GCD`, and `LCM`.

## Number Theory
* __Euler__, number-theoretic sets, and Euler's φ function.
* __Gauss__, coprimes, properties of φ; function, and Gauss' Little Theorem.
* __Mobius__, work on Möbius inversion.

## Number Patterns
* __binomial__, properties of binomial coefficients in Pascal's Triangle.
* __triangle__, properties of Leibniz's Denominator Triangle, relating to consecutive LCM.
* __primes__, properties of two-factors, and a primality test.
* __primePower__, properties of prime powers and divisors, an investigation on consecutive LCM.
* __logPower__, properties of perfect power, power free, and upper logarithm.

## Applications
* __sublist__, order-preserving sublist and properties.
