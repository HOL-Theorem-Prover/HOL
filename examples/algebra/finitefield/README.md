A finite field is a field with a finite carrier.
This imposes strong conditions on its characteristic, cardinality of its carrier,
even its classification and representation.

## Theory
* __ffBasic__, basic properties of a finite field: no vector space.
* __ffAdvanced__, advanced properties of a finite field: as a vector space over its subfield.

## Application
* __ffInstances__, GF(2), GF(4), GF(p) for prime p.
* __ffPoly__, subring polynomials, common polynomials, roots of subfield polynomials.
* __ffMaster__, master polynomials, relationship with irreducible polynomials of a subfield.
* __ffCyclo__, cyclotomic polynomials, the order of its roots.
* __ffUnity__, unity polynomials, roots of unity and the number of elements of each field order.
* __ffMinimal__, minimal polynomials, its existence by linear independence, and its properties.
* __ffConjugate__, conjugates of field elements, their orders and product of conjugate factors.
* __ffExist__, the classification of finite fields: existence and uniqueness.
* __ffExtend__, field extension by isomorphic subfield.
* __ffSplit__, splitting field of a field polynomial, and finite field as a splitting field of its special master polynomial.
