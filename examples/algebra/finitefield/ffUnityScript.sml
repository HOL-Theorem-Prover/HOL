(* Theorem: !z. z IN R /\ z <> #0 ==> (roots (unity (forder z)) = (Generated f* z).carrier) *)
(* Proof:
   Let k = forder z, g = Generated f* z.
   z IN R /\ z <> #0 ==> z IN F*            by field_nonzero_alt
   FiniteField r ==> FiniteGroup f*         by finite_field_mult_finite_group
                 ==> Group f*               by finite_group_is_group
                 ==> CARD G = k             by generated_group_card, group_order_pos, FiniteGroup f*

   First, show: !x. x IN G ==> (x ** k = #1)
   Since FiniteGroup g                      by generated_finite_group
     and (f*.id = #1) /\ (f*.exp = $** )    by field_nonzero_mult_property
   Hence !x. x IN G ==> (x ** k = #1)       by generated_Fermat, FiniteGroup g

   Next, show: G SUBSET roots (unity k)
     i.e., x IN G ==> x IN roots (unity k)  by SUBSET_DEF
     Since x IN G ==> x IN F*               by generated_subset, SUBSET_DEF
       and x IN F* ==> x IN R+              by field_mult_carrier
       and x IN R+ ==> x IN R               by field_nonzero_element
     Now  (root (unity k) x
          <=> (x ** k = #1))                by poly_unity_root_property, x IN R.
     Hence x IN roots (unity k)             by poly_roots_member

   Next, show: roots (unity k) SUBSET G, i.e. x IN roots (unity k) ==> x IN G.
     By contradiction, assume x NOTIN G.
      Then x IN (roots (unity k)) DIFF G    by IN_DIFF
        so (roots (unity k)) DIFF G <> {}   by MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY
       and G <> roots (unity k)             by DIFF_EQ_EMPTY
     Since G SUBSET roots (unity k)         by above,
        so G PSUBSET roots (unity k)        by PSUBSET_DEF
       Now roots (unity k) SUBSET R         by poly_roots_member, SUBSET_DEF
        so FINITE (roots (unity k))         by SUBSET_FINITE, FINITE R.
     Hence CARD G < CARD (roots (unity k))  by CARD_PSUBSET
        or k < CARD (roots (unity k))       by above, CARD G = k, [1].
     Since deg (unity k) = k                by poly_unity_deg
       and 0 < k                            by group_order_pos, FiniteGroup f*, k <> 0
        so unity k <> |0|                   by poly_unity_eq_zero, Ring r, #1 <> #0.
      Thus CARD (roots (unity k)) <= k      by poly_roots_count
      which contradicts [1] above.

   Since G SUBSET roots (unity k) /\ roots (unity k) SUBSET G
   Hence G = roots (unity k)                by SUBSET_ANTISYM

(* Theorem: !z. z IN R /\ z <> #0 ==> (roots (unity (forder z)) = (Generated f* z).carrier) *)
(* Proof:
   FiniteField r ==> Field r /\ FINITE R        by FiniteField_def
   z IN R /\ z <> #0 ==> z IN F*                by field_nonzero_alt
   Let k = forder z, g = Generated f* z, to show: G = roots (unity k).
   Since FiniteField r
     ==> FiniteGroup f*                         by finite_field_mult_finite_group
     ==> FiniteGroup g                          by generated_finite_group
     ==> Group f*                               by finite_group_is_group
   hence CARD G = k                             by generated_group_card, group_order_pos

   First, show: G SUBSET roots (unity k)
      By SUBSET_DEF, this is to show: x IN G ==> x IN roots (unity k)
      Since x IN G,
         so g.exp x (CARD G) = g.id             by finite_group_Fermat
         or       f*.exp x k = f*.id            by generated_property, generated_exp
         or           x ** k = #1               by field_nonzero_mult_property
         or      x ** k - #1 = #0               by field_sub_eq_zero
        Now x IN R because:
            Since g <= f*                       by generated_subgroup
               so x IN F*                       by subgroup_element
             then x IN R+                       by field_mult_carrier
               or x IN R                        by field_nonzero_element
        Since x IN R,
           eval (unity k) x = x ** k - #1 = #0  by poly_unity_eval
        so root (unity k) x                     by poly_root_def
        or x IN roots (unity k)                 by poly_roots_member

   Next, show: CARD G = CARD (roots (unity k))
      Since poly (unity k)                           by poly_unity_poly
      Need to show: unity k <> |0|, because:
         Since 0 < k                                 by group_order_pos
           and deg (unity k) = k                     by poly_unity_deg
            so unity k <> |0|                        by poly_deg_zero
      From poly (unity k) /\ unity k <> |0|,
       ==> FINITE (roots (unity k))                  by poly_roots_finite

      From G SUBSET roots (unity k),
       ==> CARD G <= CARD (roots (unity k))          by CARD_SUBSET
        or      k <= CARD (roots (unity k))          by generated_group_card
       But CARD (roots (unity k)) <= deg (unity k) by poly_roots_count
        or CARD (roots (unity k)) <= k               by poly_unity_deg

      Therefore, k = CARD (roots (unity k))          by arithmetic
         or CARD G = CARD (roots (unity k))          by generated_group_card

   Overall, G SUBSET roots (unity k) and CARD G = CARD (roots (unity k)).
       With FINITE (roots (unity k)),
        and FINITE G                                 by SUBSET_FINITE
      Hence G = roots (unity k)                      by SUBSET_EQ_CARD

Here is the continuation of fieldOrderTheory.field_order_equal_contains
|- !r. Field r ==> !n. 0 < n ==>
   !x. x IN forder_eq n ==> IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n) SUBSET forder_eq n

Note: IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n) = {x ** j | j | j IN coprimes n}
For the stronger result:
!r:'a field. FiniteField r ==> !n. 0 < n ==>
   !x. x IN (forder_eq n) ==> (forder_eq n = IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n))

We really need ffUnity, for the following:
(1) If (forder x = n),
    then every element y of order n is somewhere in the set s = {1, x, x ** 2, ...., x ** (n-1)}
    although not all n of them have order n.
    This is because:
    (a) any z IN R with (forder z = n) has z ** n = #1, hence a root of (unity n = X ** n - |1|).
    (b) all z IN s are roots of (unity n = X ** n - |1|).
        and there are no more roots:
        poly_roots_count |- !r. Field r ==> !p. poly p /\ p <> |0| ==> CARD (roots p) <= deg p
(2) Since every possible element y of order n is somewhere in the set s,
    and only index j with coprime j n can have order n by field_order_power_coprime,
    there are exactly (phi n) elements of order n, if there is at least one.
*)

(* Theorem: Field r ==> !n. 0 < n ==>
            !z. z IN R /\ (forder z = n) ==> (roots (unity n) = IMAGE (\j. z ** j) (count n)) *)
(* Proof:
   Note z <> #0                      by field_order_zero, 0 < n
    ==> z IN R+                      by field_nonzero_eq
   Let s = IMAGE (\j. z ** j) (count n).
   The goal is: roots (unity n) = s

   Claim: s SUBSET roots (unity n)
   Proof: By SUBSET_DEF, IN_IMAGE, poly_roots_member, this is to show:
          (1) z IN R ==> z ** j IN R, true   by field_exp_element
          (2) z IN R ==> root (unity n) (z ** j)
              Let m = gcd j n, x = z ** j.
              Then x IN R                    by field_exp_element
               and (forder x) * m = n        by field_order_power
                   x ** n
                 = x ** (forder x * m)       by above
                 = (x ** (forder x)) ** m    by field_exp_mult
                 = #1 ** m                   by field_order_eqn
                 = #1                        by field_one_exp
              Thus root (unity n) x          by poly_unity_root_property

   Claim: CARD s = n
   Proof: First, we show that INJ (\j. z ** j) (count n) UNIV
          By INJ_DEF, this is to show:
             j < n /\ j' < n /\ z ** j = z ** j' ==> j = j'
          Note n = forder z, so this follows by field_nonzero_exp_eq
          Note FINITE (count n)                     by FINITE_COUNT
          Thus CARD s
             = CARD (IMAGE (\j. z ** j) (count n))  by notation
             = CARD (count n)                       by INJ_CARD_IMAGE_EQN
             = n                                    by CARD_COUNT

   Assert: unity n can only have at most n roots
   Let p = unity n.
   By contradiction, suppose roots p <> s.
   Then s PSUBSET roots p             by PSUBSET_DEF, s SUBSET roots p
   Note poly p                        by poly_unity_poly
    and deg p = n                     by poly_unity_deg
    ==> p <> |0|                      by poly_deg_zero, 0 < n
   Thus FINITE (roots p)              by poly_roots_finite, poly p, p <> |0|
    ==> CARD s < CARD (roots p)       by CARD_PSUBSET, FINITE (roots p)
    But CARD (roots p) <= deg p       by poly_roots_count, poly p, p <> |0|
   This is a contradiction.

(* Theorem: FiniteField r ==> !n. 0 < n ==> (forder_eq n <> {} <=> n divides (CARD R+)) *)
(* Proof:
   If part: forder_eq n <> {} ==> n divides (CARD R+)
      Note ?x. x IN forder_eq n        by MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY
       and x IN R+ /\ (forder x = n)   by field_order_equal_element_nonzero, 0 < n
       ==> n divides (CARD R+)         by field_order_divides
   Only-if part: n divides (CARD R+) ==> forder_eq n <> {}
      By contradiction, suppose forder_eq n = {}.

      Let m = CARD R+, s = divisors m.
      Then 0 < m                       by field_nonzero_card_pos
       and FINITE s                    by divisors_finite
       ==> FINITE t                    by IMAGE_FINITE

      Step 1: partition s
      Let u = {n | n IN s /\ (forder_eq n = {})},
          v = {n | n IN s /\ forder_eq n <> {}}.
      Then FINITE u /\ FINITE v /\ split s u v   by finite_partition_by_predicate

      Step 2: get an equation for m
      Claim: SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) u = 0

      Proof: Note !x. x IN u
                   (CARD o forder_eq) x
                 = CARD (forder_eq x)      by o_THM
                 = CARD {}                 by x IN u
                 = 0                       by CARD_EMPTY
                 = (K 0) x                 by K_THM

             Thus SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) u
                 = SIGMA (K 0) u           by SUM_IMAGE_CONG
                 = 0 * CARD u              by SUM_IMAGE_CONSTANT
                 = 0                       by MULT

      Claim: SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) v = SIGMA phi v
      Proof: Note !x. x IN s /\ forder_eq x <> {}
              ==> CARD (forder_eq x) <> 0          by field_order_equal_finite, CARD_EQ_0
              and x <> 0, or 0 < x                 by divisors_has_0, x IN s, m <> 0
               so CARD (forder_eq x) = phi x       by field_order_equal_card_eqn
               or (CARD o forder_eq) x = phi x     by o_THM

             Thus SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) v
                = SIGMA phi v                      by SUM_IMAGE_CONG

      Therefore,
             m = SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) s        by field_order_equal_over_divisors_sigma_card
               = SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) u + SIGMA (CARD o forder_eq) v   by SUM_IMAGE_DISJOINT
               = 0 + SIGMA phi v                   by Claims
               = SIGMA phi v                       by arithmetic, [1]

      Step 3: get a contradiction
      Note n <= m                        by DIVIDES_LE, n divides m
        so n IN s                        by divisors_element
       ==> forder n IN u                 by IN_IMAGE
        or u <> {}                       by MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY
       ==> v <> s                        by finite_partition_property
       But v SUBSET s                    by SUBSET_UNION
        so v PSUBSET s                   by PSUBSET_DEF, v <> s
      Also !x. x IN s ==> phi x <> 0     by phi_eq_0, divisors_has_0, m <> 0
      Thus SIGMA phi v < SIGMA phi s     by SUM_IMAGE_PSUBSET_LT, [2]

       Now SIGMA phi s = m               by Gauss_little_thm
      Therefore m < m                    by [1], [2]
      This is impossible, a contradiction.

(* Theorem: FiniteField r ==>
            !n. (?s. s <<= r /\ (fdim s = n)) <=> ?x. x IN R+ /\ (forder x = char r ** n - 1) *)
(* Proof:
   Let p = char r.
   If part: s <<= r ==> ?x. x IN R+ /\ (forder x = p ** fdim s - 1)
   Idea: A subfield is a finite field, so it has a primitive.
         The primitive is in R+, with order = CARD B*

      Note FiniteField s            by subfield_finite_field
       and B* = ring_nonzero s      by field_mult_carrier
      Note ?x. x IN B* /\ (order s* x = CARD B* )  by field_order_exists, DIVIDES_REFL, FiniteField s
       and order s* x = forder x    by subfield_order, field_nonzero_element
           CARD B*
         = CARD B - 1               by finite_field_nonzero_carrier_card
         = p ** fdim s - 1          by finite_field_card_alt, subfield_char
       and x IN B* ==> x IN R+      by subfield_nonzero_element
      Take this x, the result follows.

   Only-if part: x IN R+ /\ (forder x = p ** n - 1) ==> ?s. s <<= r /\ (fdim s = n)
   Idea: forder x = k means x ** j for j = 1 to k  are distinct.
         These are roots of X ** k - |1|, and no more since CARD (roots p) <= deg p when p <> |0|.
         Add in #0, then {#0} UNION (roots (unity k)) = roots (master (k + 1)).
         The roots of (master (k + 1) forms a subfield.
         Take s = subset_field r (roots (master (k + 1))),
         Express CARD B to find the dimension (fdim s = n).

      Let k = p ** n - 1.
      Note n <> 0                            by field_order_eq_0, field_nonzero_eq, EXP_0
       and 1 < p                             by finite_field_char_gt_1
        so 1 < p ** n                        by ONE_LT_EXP
      Thus 0 < k /\ (p ** n = k + 1)         by arithmetic
      Take s = subset_field r (roots (master (k + 1))).
      Then s <<= r                           by poly_master_roots_subfield
      The remaining goal: fdim s = n
      Note B = roots (master (k + 1))        by subset_field_property
             = {#0} UNION roots (unity k)    by poly_master_roots_by_unity_roots_alt
      Also FINITE (roots (unity k))          by poly_unity_roots_finite, 0 < k

(* Proof:
     Note #1 <> #0                             by poly_deg_pos_ring_one_ne_zero, 0 < deg z
     By contradiction, suppose p = |0|.
     Then deg |0| = 0                          by poly_deg_zero
       so (peval (unity n) |0| == |0|) (pm z)  by above
      But   peval (unity n) |0|

          = |0| - |1|                          by poly_zero_exp, 0 < n.
     Therefore ( |0| - |1| == |0|) (pm z)      by above

Another view on Roots of Unity.

Take Field r = Z_2 = {0, 1}
Q. What are the square roots in r ?
A. Square roots are solutions of (x^2 - 1 = 0) in r.
   Since x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)^2  in r = Z_2,
   There are two square roots in r: 1 doubled, (or 1 and -1 = 1).
Q. What are the cube roots in r ?
A. Cube roots are solutions of (x^3 - 1 = 0) in r.
   Since x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1), and (x^2 + x + 1) is irreducible,
   Only 1 cube root in r: 1.
Q. That means r is too small. Can we make r bigger to have 3 cube roots ?
A. (Galois)
   Easy. Invent an imaginary w with the property w^3 = 1 (implicitly w <> 1, w^2 <> 1, only w^3 = 1).
   That is, adjoin r with w, a primitive cube root of unity.
   To form a field, add to r all the possible sums and products with w. The result:
   [0,0] --> 0
   [1,0] --> 1
   [0,1] --> w
   [1,1] --> w+1
   This system Z_2[w] is isomorphic to F_4, and in F_4, x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - w)(x - w^2),
   so F_4 has 3 cube roots: 1, w, w^2.
A. (Cauchy)
   Hold on. Since x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1), and (x^2 + x + 1) is irreducible,
   Let h = x^2 + x + 1, and consider the system Z_2[x]/h. This quotient structure is:
   [0,0] --> 0
   [1,0] --> 1
   [0,1] --> x
   [1,1] --> x+1
   This system Z_2[x]/h is (again) isomorphic to F_4, with 3 cube roots: 1, x, x^2.

Q. How about 4th roots of unity?
A. Well, x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)^2(x + 1)^2 = (x - 1)^4, so 4 roots: 1 with multiplicity 4.

Q. How about 5th roots of unity?
A. Well, x^5 - 1 = (x - 1) h, where h = (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) is irreducible. Only 1 5th-root.
   Adjoin a primitive 5th-root of unity, or form the quotient field by h, get the structure:
   [0,0,0,0] --> 0
   ...
   [1,1,1,1] --> x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
   This is isomorphic to F_(2^4) = F_16, with 15 nonzero elements.
   Indeed ((F_16).prod - 0) with 15 elements is cyclic, so it has a generator t, order t = 15.
   Therefore element w = t^3 has order 15/3 = 5, and the 5 5th-roots in F_16 are: t^3, t^6, t^9, t^12, t^15 = 1.

Q. How about k-th roots of unity?
A. Well, x^k - 1 = (x - 1)(cyclic k), and (cyclic k) must have an irreducible factor h.
   Adjoin a primitive k-th root of unity, or form the quotient field by h, get the structure:
   [0,0,0,..,0] --> 0
   ...
   [1,1,1,..,1] --> x^d + ... + 1  where d = deg h.
   This is isomorphic to F_(2^d), with 2^d - 1 nonzero elements.
   The multiplicative group of F_(2^d) is cyclic, with a generator t, order t = 2^d - 1.
   Now, k must divide 2^d - 1, so that w = t^(2^d - 1 DIV k) will have order w = k.
   Is this always true? a Theorem?
   Yes, since t^(order t) = 1. If k does not divide (order t), there is no way 1 is a cubic root.

Picture:  F* = {s, s^2, s^3, ...... , s^(order g s) = 1}, all distinct, order g s = CARD (F* )
I know:       ?             t = s^j, j divides (order g s), t ** n = 1.
Since j divides (order g s), let (order g s) = m * j.
Then      t, t^2, t^3, ..., t^m = 1 are distinct roots of z = X^n - |1|
Is there any t^u = 1 with u < m ?
If there is, 1 = t^u = (s^j)^u = s^(j * u)   j * u < j * m = (order g s), but (order g s) is minimal!

However, this only shows (ord t = m), which can be shown by other means.
What I want is: ord t = n.
Since  t^n = 1, and none of other t^u = 1, can I conclude n = m ?
Only catch: n can be a multiple of m.
How about, once s is known, let t = s^((order g s) DIV n)  assume n divides (order g s).
Then t, t^2, t^3, .., t^n = 1 are distinct roots of z = X^n - |1|,
so (ord t = n).
But how to assert: n divides (order g s) = CARD G ?
Well, the n distinct roots form a subgroup of g, hence n divides (CARD G)
-- but this is after we know n divides (CARD G) !
CARD G = (char r)^(deg h) - 1

Example, r = Z_2, looking for 6-th roots.
X^6 - 1 = (X^3 - 1)^2  hence roots: only 3 cubic roots, each with multiplicity 2.
If looking for n-th roots, not coprime n 2, i.e. gcd n 2 <> 1, then since prime 2, g n 2 = 2, or n = q * 2
X^n - 1 = X^(q * 2) - 1 = (X^q)^2 - 1 = (X^q - 1)^2, hence roots: all q roots, each doubled.
If looking for n-th roots, coprime n 2, i.e. coprime n (char r).
coprime (char r) (CARD G), does that implies coprime n (CARD G) ?
gcd (a b) = 1, gcd (b c) = 1, gcd (a c) = ?
gcd (4 3) = 1, gcd (3 8) = 1, gcd (4 8) = 2.
n divides (CARD G) must be given as a condition.
or just require (order t = CARD (roots z)).
