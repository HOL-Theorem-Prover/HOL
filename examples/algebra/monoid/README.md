# Monoid Library

A monoid as an algebraic structure: with a carrier set, a binary operation and an identity element.

## Theory
* __monoid__, axioms and basic properties.
* __monoidOrder__, exponentiation and element order,
* __monoidMap__, homomorphism and isomorphism between monoids.
* __submonoid__, properties of submonoid, as homomorphic image of identity map.

## Application
* __monoidInstances__, Zn as an additive monoid, also a multiplicative monoid.
