Originally, the structure of (forder_eq n) is investigated in ffUnity,
because if forder x = n, then x ** n = #1, thus x is a root of (unity n).
In ffUnity, we show that roots of (unity n) has a generator.
Effectively we show that roots of (unity n) is cyclic, and work from there.

Here is a rework of the structure of (forder_eq n), by elementary means.
The aim is to retrace Gauss' proof of cyclic f* for FiniteField r.
ffAdvancedTheory.finite_field_mult_group_cyclic |- !r. FiniteField r ==> cyclic f*
Gauss' proof is by an ingenious counting argument, based on Gauss_little_thm.

(* Theorem: Field r ==> !n. 0 < n ==>
            !x. x IN (forder_eq n) ==> IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n) SUBSET (forder_eq n) *)
(* Proof:
   Note x IN R /\ (forder x = n)            by field_order_equal_element
   By SUBSET, this is to show:
      !z. z IN IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n) ==> z IN (forder_eq n)
    Let z = x ** j IN IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n)      by IN_IMAGE
   Then j IN coprimes n ==> coprime j n     by coprimes_element
   Note x ** j IN R                         by field_exp_element
        forder (x ** j)
      = forder x                            by field_order_power_coprime
      = n                                   by above

Note: IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n) = {x ** j | j | j IN coprimes n}
Note: This is the best that can be proved here.
For the stronger result:
!r:'a field. FiniteField r ==> !n. 0 < n ==>
   !x. x IN (forder_eq n) ==> (forder_eq n = IMAGE (\j. x ** j) (coprimes n))

We really need ffUnity, for the following:
(1) If (forder x = n),
    then every element y of order n is somewhere in the set s = {1, x, x ** 2, ...., x ** (n-1)}
    although not all n of them have order n.
    This is because:
    (a) any z IN R with (forder z = n) has z ** n = #1, hence a root of (unity n = X ** n - |1|).
    (b) all z IN s are roots of (unity n = X ** n - |1|).
        and there are no more roots:
        poly_roots_count |- !r. Field r ==> !p. poly p /\ p <> |0| ==> CARD (roots p) <= deg p
(2) Since every possible element y of order n is somewhere in the set s,
    and only index j with coprime j n can have order n by field_order_power_coprime,
    there are exactly (phi n) elements of order n, if there is at least one.

(* Theorem: FiniteField r ==> (BIGUNION (IMAGE forder_eq (divisors (CARD R+))) = R+) *)
(* Proof:
   Let m = CARD R+.
   Then 0 < m                    by field_nonzero_card_pos
   By EXTENSION, IN_BIGUNION, divisors_element, this is to show:
   (1) x IN s ==> x IN R+   where s = forder_eq n for some n divides m
       Note x IN s ==> x IN R /\ forder x divides m    by field_order_equal_element
       But x <> #0, for otherwise
           x = #0 ==> forder x = 0                     by field_order_eq_0
           forder x divides m ==> m = 0                by ZERO_DIVIDES
           This contradicts 0 < m.
       Thus x IN R+                                    by field_nonzero_eq
   (2) x IN R+ ==> ?s. x IN s /\ ?n. (s = forder_eq n) /\ n <= m /\ n divides m
       Note x IN R+ ==> (forder x) divides m           by field_order_divides
       Put n = forder x, and s = forder_eq n.
       Note x IN R               by field_nonzero_eq
       Then x IN s               by field_order_equal_element
