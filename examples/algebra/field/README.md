# Field Library

A field is a non-trivial ring with all nonzero elements invertible.

## Theory
* __field__, definition and basic properties.
* __fieldOrder__, multiplicative order of elements in a field.
* __fieldProduct__, product of a set of field elements, and its manipulation.
* __fieldIdeal__, ideals in a field. Quotient ring is a field iff the ideal is maximal.
* __fieldMap__, homomorphism and isomorphism between fields.

## Application
* __fieldInstances__, Zp, integers within a prime modulus p.
* __fieldBinomial__, binomial coefficients and binomial expansion in a field, the "Freshmen" theorem.
