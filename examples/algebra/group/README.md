# Group library

A group is an algebraic structure: a monoid with all its elements invertible.

## Theory
* __group__, definition and basic properties.
* __groupMap__, homomorphism and isomorphism between groups.
* __subgroup__, properties of subgroup: a subset of a group and cosets.
* __quotientGroup__, group partition by a normal subgroup.
* __groupOrder__, group element order.
* __groupProduct__, iteration of group operation.

## Application
* __symmetryGroup__, symmetry group of all permutations of a set of symbols.
* __groupInstances__, Zn as additive group, Zp when p is prime as multiplicative group.
* __finiteGroup__, finite group properties.
* __groupAction__, action on a group to a target.
* __groupCyclic__, cyclic group properties.
* __congruences__, congruences for number theory, Fermat's Little Theorem.
* __corres__, Correspondence Theorem for group theory.
