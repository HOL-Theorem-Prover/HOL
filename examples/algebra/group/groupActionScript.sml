Group action
============
. action f is a map from Group g to target set X, satisfying some conditions.
. The action induces an equivalence relation "reach" on target set X.
. The equivalent classes of "reach" on A are called orbits.
. Due to this partition, CARD X = SIGMA CARD orbits.
. As equivalent classes are non-empty, minimum CARD orbit = 1.
. These singleton orbits have a 1-1 correspondence with a special set on A:
  the fixed_points. The main result is:
  CARD X = CARD fixed_points + SIGMA (CARD non-singleton orbits).

  When group action is applied to necklaces, Z[n] enters into the picture.
  The cyclic Z[n] of modular addition is the group for necklaces of n beads.

Rework
======
. name target set Xs X, with points x, y, use a, b as group elements.
. keep x, y as group elements, a, b as set A elements.
. orbit is defined as image, with one less parameter.
. orbits is named, replacing TargetPartition.

(* Proof:
   Let R = reach f g.
   Note !e. e IN orbits f g X ==> CARD e = n by orbits_equal_size_partition_equal_size
    and R equiv_on X                  by reach_equiv
    and orbits f g X = partition R X  by orbits_eq_partition
   Thus n divides CARD X
      = n * CARD (partition R X)      by equal_partition_card
      = CARD (partition R X) * n      by MULT_SYM
     so n divides (CARD X)            by divides_def
   The last part is simplified by:

Fixed Points have singleton orbits -- although it is not defined in this way,
this property is the theorem fixed_points_orbit_sing.

This important property of fixed points gives this simple trick:
to count how many singleton orbits, just count the set (fixed_points f g X).

Since orbits are equivalent classes, they cannot be empty, hence singleton
orbits are the simplest type. For equivalent classes:

CARD Target = SUM CARD (orbits)
            = SUM CARD (singleton orbits) + SUM CARD (non-singleton orbits)
