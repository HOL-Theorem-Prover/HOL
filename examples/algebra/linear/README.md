# Linear Library

A vector space considers the interplay between its scalar field and vector actions.

## Theory
* __VectorSpace__, definition and basic properties.
* __SpanSpace__, basis, vector sum, and spanning space.
* __LinearIndep__, change of basis and linear independence.

## Application
* __FiniteVSpace__, finite vector space, subspaces and dimension.
