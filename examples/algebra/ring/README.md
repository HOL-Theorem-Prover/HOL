A ring takes into account the interplay between its additive group and multiplicative monoid.

## Theory
* __ring__, definition and basic properties.
* __ringUnit__, units in a ring, the invertibles of its multiplicative monoid.
* __ringMap__, homomorphism and isomorphism between rings.
* __ringIdeal__, ideals in a ring. Prinicpal and maximal ideals, Principal Ideal ring and Euclidean ring.
* __quotientRing__, ring partition by an ideal. Kernel ideal and first isomorphism theorem.
* __ringDivides__, divisibility in ring, associates and greatest common divisor in Euclidean rings.
* __integralDomain__, integral domain as an algebraic structure: a non-trivial ring without zero divisors.

# Application
* __ringInstances__, Zn, integers within positive modulo n.
* __ringBinomial__, binomial coefficients and binomial expansion in a ring.
* __integralDomainInstances__, Zp for prime p.
* __ringInteger__, integers as a ring, its ideals and its quotient rings.
