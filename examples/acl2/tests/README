INSTRUCTIONS:

WARNING! Before running ./doit, edit the editable variables in file
../.acl2holrc.bash.

In this directory (or most likely, in any directory), run testbench
script doit.  This will certify any uncertified books in inputs/
(first certifying any uncertified tool books in ../lisp/), then
generate "essential" .lisp files in directory results/, which should
then have identical contents to directory gold/.  If so, then
"Success!" is printed and the exit status is 0.  Otherwise the exit
status is non-zero and the error message will direct you to file
diffout and the logs/ directory (though if certification fails then
you may also want to see inputs/).

Note: Only minimal effort has been made (at least for updating to ACL2
Version 4.0) to maintain round-trip/gold/axioms.lisp and
round-trip/gold/axioms.ml.  Instead, to update to a new ACL2 version,
we just do the following:
(1) Run ./doit.  It should complete except for complaints in
    round-trip/diffout regarding the above two files.
(2) Do a quick comparison of round-trip/results/axioms.lisp with
    round-trip/gold/axioms.lisp.  If these seem reasonably compatible,
    then just copy the former to the latter.
(3) Run ./doit again.  This time, do an extremely brief comparison of
    axioms.ml in the above two directories, and if nothing seems
    amiss, copy round-trip/results/axioms.ml to round-trip/gold/.
(4) Run ./doit again, and you should see "SUCCESS!".

See the end of this README file for information on the example from
Sandip Ray et al. on correctness of cone-of-influence reduction.

Contents of this directory:

Supplied files and directories:

README          This file
doit		Script that runs tests: execute ./doit
gold/           Expected results:
		  ../lisp/book-essence.csh generates .lisp files
		  ../lisp/a2ml.csh generates .ml files from the
		      generated .lisp files
inputs/         Input files for tests, and a Makefile to generate their
                  certifications (hence this directory can contain
		  .cert files, compiled files, and .out files from
                  certification)
round-trip/	Subdirectory for round-trip (ACL2->HOL->ACL2) testing
obsolete/	Stuff I think we can safely discard, though I'll be
		  more confident of that after we complete a
		  round-trip test

Generated files and directories:

diffout         Test failure data
diffout.old     Test failure data from previous test
logs/           Test logs (for generating results/ data)
old-logs/       Test logs from previous test
results/        Results of tests (essential events in .lisp files),
		  generated as explained above for gold/
old-results/    Results of tests from previous test

==============================

Regarding the example from Sandip Ray et al. on correctness of
cone-of-influence reduction:

The files from that example in inputs/ are as follows, although the
only generated files we need are the .ml files in gold/ listed just
below.

  apply-total-order.lisp
  circuit-bisim.lisp
  circuits.lisp
  cone-of-influence.lisp
  encap1.lisp
  ltl.lisp
  records.lisp
  sets.lisp
  summary.lisp
  test1.lisp
  test1a.lisp
  test2.lisp
  total-order.lisp

  apply-total-order.ml
  records.ml
  summary.ml
  total-order.ml

See files inputs/*.lisp for explanatory comments, which are gone in
the generated gold/*.lisp files.  File summary.lisp is his top-level
book, and I could write a tool to figure out what supports it (in this
case apply-total-order, records, and total-order).
