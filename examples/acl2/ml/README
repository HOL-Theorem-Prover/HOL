Notes
-----

translateScript creates and runs a .lisp script containing proofs 
that the functions defined are equivalent to those in ACL2. The 
variables acl2_executable and acl2_test_file point to the locations
of the acl2 executable and script file.

The role of defaxiomsTheory is to define goals that are proved in the
theories hol_defaxiomsTheory and hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory.  It
contains ACL2-tagged theorems cretated by slurping in the ACL2
generated file lisp/defaxioms.lisp.trans.ml, so its soundness relies
on that of ACL2 and the linking infrastructure. In contrast,
hol_defaxiomsTheory is a pure HOL theory. It defines a subset of the
constants in defaxiomsTheory (namely those constants occurring in
axioms), and hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory has pure HOL proofs of the
axioms (currently incomplete).

To print out defaxioms as ACL2 (for round-trip testing), run hol and do:

 load "defaxiomsTheory"; 
 sexp.print_imported_acl2_theorems "defaxioms" "defaxioms.roundtrip";

To simplify the proved defaxioms (using the rewrites shown below) and
then print them into a file defaxioms.prove.lisp, run hol and do:
 
 load "hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory";
 val defaxioms = theorems "hol_defaxioms_proofs";
 open sexpTheory;
 val simp_defaxioms = 
  map
   (I ## SIMP_RULE std_ss

          asym_def,csym_def,ksym_def,osym_def,
