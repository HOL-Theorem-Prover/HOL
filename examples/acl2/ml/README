Notes
-----

translateScript creates and runs a .lisp script containing proofs 
that the functions defined are equivalent to those in ACL2. The 
variables acl2_executable and acl2_test_file point to the locations
of the acl2 executable and script file.

The role of defaxiomsTheory, which is built by Holmake (see
Holmakefile), is for round-trip testing (see below) and to generate
goals that are then properly proved in the theories
hol_defaxiomsTheory and hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory.  It contains
ACL2-tagged theorems created by slurping in the ACL2 generated file
lisp/defaxioms.lisp.trans.ml, so its soundness relies on that of ACL2
and the linking infrastructure. In contrast, hol_defaxiomsTheory is a
pure HOL theory. It defines a subset of the constants in
defaxiomsTheory (namely those constants occurring in axioms), and
hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory has pure HOL proofs of the axioms.

For round-trip testing (i.e. check infrastructure for transferring
S-expressions between HOL and ACL2 on concrete examples), run hol and
do:

 load "defaxiomsTheory"; 
 sexp.print_imported_acl2_theorems "defaxioms" "defaxioms.roundtrip";

Not that defaxiomsTheory contains values of type thm that are not
proved in HOL, but created using mk_oracle_thm from data imported
from ACL2.

To simplify the proved defaxioms (using the rewrites shown below) and
then print them into a file defaxioms.prove.lisp, run hol and do:
 
 load "hol_defaxioms_proofsTheory";
 val defaxioms = theorems "hol_defaxioms_proofs";
 open sexpTheory;
 val simp_defaxioms = 
  map
   (I ## SIMP_RULE std_ss
          [itel_def,andl_def,List_def,
          asym_def,csym_def,ksym_def,osym_def,
          ACL2_def,COMMON_LISP_def,KEYWORD_def,ACL2_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_def])
   defaxioms;
 sexp.print_thms_to_defthms simp_defaxioms "defaxioms.prove";

To slurp in "examples/encap/example.ml" do:

  load "hol_defaxiomsTheory";
  load "sexp";
  quietdec := true; open sexp; quietdec := false;
  use "../examples/encap/example.ml";
  map (install_def o mk_acl2def) (!acl2_list_ref);
