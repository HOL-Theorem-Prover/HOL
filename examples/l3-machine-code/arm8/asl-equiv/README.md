Armv8 ISA specification equivalence proof.

Relates L3 model with an model derived from Arm ASL, see:

- [Arm Exploration Tool](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/exploration-tools)
- [MRA tool](https://github.com/alastairreid/mra_tools)
- [ASL Interpreter](https://github.com/alastairreid/asl-interpreter)
- [ASL to Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/asl_to_sail)
- [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail)

A pre-generated HOL4 snapshot of the ASL model can be obtained by cloning it from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arm-research/security/mra-hol-snapshots)

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/arm-research/security/mra-hol-snapshots.git
```
	
or (equivalently)
	
```shell
$ ./get-mra-hol-snapshots
```
