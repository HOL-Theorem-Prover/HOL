Axiomatic specification of type ``:zfset`` satisfying Zermelo Fraenkel axioms
=============================================================================

The axioms of ZF set theory are defined in:

 zfset_axiomsScript.sml

This is a port (done in 2007) of an ancient (1994) HOL88 file to HOL4. 

In 2009 another 1994 file, containing some theorems proved from the ZF
axioms, was ported to HOL4. This is:

 zfsetScript.sml

The original HOL88 development is described at: 

 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/papers/holst/index.html

The files ported to HOL4 are just the axioms and theorems. The
experimental infrastructure for moving between HOL and ZF has not been
ported (it never really worked).

Note that in the HOL88 theory, the type of sets is called "V", but it
is renamed "zfset" in the HOL4 theory. A few other changes have been
made. For example, the name of the membership relation in HOL88 was
"::" and now it is "In".  Also, the special abstraction syntax
{t[x1,...,xn] | X, p[x1,...,xn]} is not supported (but finite set
notation {x1;...;xn} is). 

A set like {t[x1,...,xn] | X, p[x1,...,xn]} is represented by:

 Spec X (\s. ?x1...xn. (s = t[x1,...,xn]) /\ p[x1,...,xn])

where Spec satisfies: x In Spec s p <=> x In s /\ p x (and is defined
via the axiom of separation: !p s. ?t. !x. x In t = x In s /\ p x).
For example, the product X # Y was defined in HOL88 as:

 {Pair x1 x2 | Pow(Pow(X U Y)), (x1 :: X /\ x2 :: Y)}

but in HOL4 is defined as:

 Spec (Pow(Pow(X U Y))) (\s. ?x1 x2. (s = Pair x1 x2) /\ x1 In X /\ x2 In Y)
