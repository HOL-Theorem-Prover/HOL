INTRODUCTION

This file illustrates, through examples, how the ARM compiler from
arm_progLib can be used. The compiler's top-level function is

  arm_progLib.arm_compile (def:thm) (ind:thm) (as_proc:arm_code_format)

Here def is a definition, ind is the induction rule produced by Define
and as_proc is a flag indicating what the format of the resulting ARM
code ought to take (e.g. procedure or not).

In order to keep the presentation consice we define test_compile and
test_compile_proc:

*)

fun find_ind_thm def = let
  val tm = (fst o dest_eq o concl o SPEC_ALL) def
  val name = (fst o dest_const) ((fst o dest_comb) tm handle e => tm)
  in fetch "-" (name^"_ind") handle e => TRUTH end;

fun test_compile' as_proc q = let
  val def = Define q
  val ind = find_ind_thm def
  val (th,strs) = arm_compile def ind as_proc
 (* val _ = map print (["\n\n\n"] @ strs @ ["\n\n\n"]) *)
  in (def,ind,th) end;

fun test_compile q = test_compile' InLineCode q;
val test_compile_proc = test_compile'

(*

The compiler expects def to be a function where variables have names
r0,r1,r2,...,r12 or m0,m1,m2 .... The variable names tells the compiler
how to assign physical resources to each logical variable, e.g.

  r1  - becomes register 1
  m5  - becomes memory location at address stack pointer + 5

The functions it accepts must conform to the following grammar.
Let r range over register names (r0,r1,r2,etc), m range over
memory locations (m0,m1,m2,etc), f over function names,
i over natural numbers (<32) and w over 8-bit word constants.

  p    ::=  let r = exp in p
         |  let m = r in p
         |  let (v,v,...,v) = f (v,v,...,v) in p
         |  if g then p else p
         |  (v,v,...,v)

  v    ::=  r  |  m
  g    ::=  ~ g  |  r cmp mode  |  r && mode = 0w
  cmp  ::=  =  |  <  |  <+  |  <=  |  <=+
  exp  ::=  m  |  mode  |  ~ mode  |  r op mode  |  r * r
  op   ::=  + | - | && | ?? | !!
  mode ::=  w  |  r  |  r << i  |  r >> i  |  r >>> i

The only dissallowed combination of the above is "let ri = rj * rk in ..."
in which ri and rj must not be the same variable name. (There are also some
restrictions regarding varaible names in function calls.)

Notice that the grammer from above dissallows:

  let r0 = (if r1 < r2 then 5w else r6) in P

Such conditionals need to be expanded out, e.g.

  if r1 < r2 then
    let r0 = 5w in P
  else
    let r0 = r6 in P

A naive compilation would duplicate the code for P. We optimise
"common code tails" and that way, to a large extent, avoid duplication
of code (See section of shared-tails for more).

(* TEST: constant functions *)

    let r0 = 0w in
    let r1 = 45w in
    let r2 = ~r1 in
      (r0,r1,r2)`;

(* Each let-expression is compiled into one ARM instruction or
   procedure call. The code for load_const above becomes:

     mov r0, #0
     mov r1, #45
     mvn r2, r1
*)

(* Looping functions are required to be tail-recursive and
   the recurive calls need to be identical to the left-hand side of
   the definition of the function, i.e.

     f (r1,r2) = let .... in f (r2,r3)

   "SimpleProcedure" must not contain any procedure calls or direct use of
   register 14.

   Use the option "PushProcedure ([],0)" when the function to be compiled contains
   procedure calls or uses register 14 as a temporary (which is allowed!).
   The option "PushProcedure ([],0)" will push the return address onto the stack and
   hence allows nested procedure calls.

   Example: the function c1 (below) uses registers 11 and 12 as temporaries and

(* TEST: procedure calls with memory accesses *)

(* So far we have required that procedure/function calls are identical
   to the definition of the function which they call, e.g. a call to
   foo, defined by

     foo (r0,m1) =
       let ... in (r3,m2)  ,

   must be of the form "let (r3,m2) = foo(r0,m1)", since the variable
   names indicate in which resources the input/result values are stored.

   However, the new option PushProcedure is an exception to the above
   rule of thumb. The option PushProcedure alters the stack pointer, and
   hence what used to be at offset, say, 5 from the stack pointer (i.e. m5)
   may actually be at offset 6 (i.e. m6) from inside a subroutine. As
   a result the numbers that follow variable names that refer to the stack
   need to be shifted slightly when calling procedures that are complied
   using PushProcedure. Example:
*)

val _ = reset_compiled();

(* foo is compiled to push the link register onto the stack. *)

val (foo_def,_,foo_arm) = test_compile_proc (PushProcedure ([],0)) `

  supfoo (r0,m0) =
    let (r3,m1) = foo(r0,m0) in
    let r2 = m1 in
      (r2,r3)`;

(* To illustrate how the stack elements work, let the following depict
   a stack with q at the top, then z as the second element, then y and x,

     ...|x|y|z|q|

   One uses offset 0 to access q, offset 2 to access y.

   Suppose we run supfoo on a stack with y on top and x second

     ...|x|y|

   then the execution starts by performing a call to foo, which pushes
   the return address onto the stack:

     ...|x|y|address|

   We see that what used to be at offset i from the top of the stack
   is now at offset i+1. When the procedure returns it pops the return
   address off the stack, hence when "let r2 = m1" is to execute the
   stack is the following (here z is the value which foo calculated):

     ...|z|y|

   The general case: PushProcedure (xs,i) will shift the stack pointer
   by length xs + i + 1.
*)



(* TEST: procedure calls with register spilling *)

(* Suppose all values used in a computation don't fit into the registers.
   We can create temporary stack space by altering the stack poniter in
   procedures that are compiled using the option PushProcedure.

   PushProcedure (xs,i) shifts the stack pointer i steps, e.g.
   When entering a function compiled with the option
   PushProcedure (["r1","r2","r3"],2) it will start by pushing the return
   address and values of registers 1, 2 and 3 onto the stack

     ...|address|v1|v2|v3|

   It then alters the stack pointer to add two more elements:

     ...|address|v1|v2|v3|t1|t2|

   The stack locations where address,v1,v2,v3 are stored (i.e. m5,m4,m3,m2)
   must not be touched since these are used by the procedure context switch.
   But the stack locations where the (unspecified) t1 and t2 are stored can be
   used temporary scratch space.

   Example below.

Use arm_flatten_code() to prove and print a concrete version of
the procedure call graph:

val _ = arm_flatten_code ();

It returns the correctness theorem of the last verified procedure with
the code flattened to one sequence with concrete procedure calls.

Warning: this function is at present rather slow.
