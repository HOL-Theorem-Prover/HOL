In his work "A Practical Theory of Programming", Dr. Eric Hehner proposed that 
programs can be treated as mathematical objects. Thus proofs of programs are 
simply mathematical proofs and software that handles proofs in various areas 
of mathematics such as HOL4/Kananaskis can be used for verification that 
programs meet their specifications. 

In this directory:
- ptopScript.sml presents logical definitions for commands such as assignment, 
  and sequential composition. It also provides a definition of software 
  refinement.
- imperativeLib.sml provides some proof tactics that are useful proving 
  refinement of a logical specification by a program. Programs can be written 
  using any of imperative commands defined in ptopTheory
- imperativeScript.sml uses tactics to prove laws such as the forwardSubstition
  law
- selftest.sml demonstrates the theory as it applies to verifying the 
  correctness of two programs that swap x for y
- reflectOnFailure.sml demonstrates how the theory detects potential bugs
  and the process involved in disproving refinement

This example provides updated software originally discused at 2010 NECEC
conference. NECEC 2010 is a forum where professionals in electrical, 
electronic and computer engineering as well as information technologies can 
present their work to the growing technical community within the province. 
The conference focuses on technical concepts, innovations and implementations.
