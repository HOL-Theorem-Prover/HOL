(* Naming conventions:
    - prefix "c_" is used to mean "compile"
    - argument names:
       t - boolean indicating tail position (true if in tail position)
       l - location where the next instruction will be placed in memory
           (relative to first instruction of the entire program)
       vs - a model of the stack: the ith element is SOME v if the value
            of source variable v is at stack index i; positions containing
            NONE do not correspond to a source-level variable; this information
            is used by when compiling Var (in the c_var function)
       fs - an a-list with locations for all the function locations,
            compilation of Call (in c_exp) uses this information
