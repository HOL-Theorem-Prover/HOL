Lexer Generator. 

The lexer generator takes a list of (regexp * action-function) pairs
and generates a "maximal-munch" style lexer. The lexer is
Brzozowski-derivative based, and hence execution proceeds in a
interpreted style. See the examples file.

Original theories are from Scott Owens. 
Konrad Slind ported the proofs and added examples.
