Overview
========

The code in this directory generates DFAs from regular expressions
using the technique of Brzozowski derivatives. There is a full formal
definition and correctness proof of a regexp compiler, along with some
ML support code.  In particular, there are two mechanisms---meeting a
single interface---available for compiling regexps to DFAs. 

  1. HOL proof
  2. SML code with no proofs generated

Both are available through loading regexpLib into HOL4. There is also
a standalone executable "regexp2dfa" that generates state machines to
std_out in a variety of programming languages.


Concrete syntax of regular expressions
=======================================

See test.ml and test.hol for examples.

  [...] = character set 
  [^...] = complement char set
  .  = any char
  \d = [0-9]
  \w = [a-zA-Z0-9_] 
  \s = whitespace = [ \n\r\t\f]  (* Note the space character! *)
  \c = escape c, for c in {\,`,.,^,$,*,+,?,|,~,{,},[,],(,)}
  \ddd = ASCII character given in decimal representation (\000 to \255)
  \i{lo,hi,dir} = 
     Interval of numbers between lo and hi inclusive, with dir in {MSB,LSB}. 
     The "dir" field can be omitted (it defaults to LSB). Numbers can be
     unsigned (both lo and hi are positive) or signed twos complement
     (lo is negative, hi can be positive or negative). Currently only 
     binary representation is supported.
  \p{e_1 ... e_n} = 
     "Packed" intervals, where e_i can be either an interval specification
     (lo,hi) or a padding specification .{n} (meaning "ignore the next n bits").
     The sum of the widths of the e_i must be a multiple of 8.
     Packing specifications support scenarios where adjacent intervals
     don't line up on byte boundaries. For example, suppose one
     interval needs 9 bits to represent and the adjacent interval
     needs only 6 to represent. Then the two intervals can be
     supported in 2 bytes via the \p{...} specification, rather than
     the 3 bytes needed by the \i{...}\i{...} representation. Also
     intended to be used for packing multiple intervals into a single
     byte. 
    
  r|s = alternation
  r&s = intersection
  r* = Kleene star
  r+ = rr*
  r? = "" | r
  r{n} = r^n
  r{m,n} = r^m | r^{m+1} | ... | r^n (m<=n)
  r{m,} = r{m}r*
  r{,n} = r{0,n}
  rs  = concatenation
  ~r = complement
  (r) = grouping 

Note: For now, as traditional, spaces are significant in regexp
concrete syntax.

Note: The regexp parser (implemented in Regexp_Type) is external to
HOL and produces elements of the ML regexp datatype. Maps between the
ML regexp datatype and HOL terms of type regexp may be found in
regexpSyntax.



Directory structure and content
===============================

The following are the important ML structures and HOL theories.

Regexp_Type

   * SML definition of the type of regular expressions. This lies at
     the base of both "proof" and "code" paths.

   * The size of the alphabet (default 256) can be set here. Note that
     large alphabets like Unicode will need a different approach. Also
     note that the interval regexp support assumes that the alphabet
     size is 256.

   * There is a regexp parser implementation (entrypoints:
     fromSubstring, fromString, fromQuote). See above for the concrete
     syntax. The files test.ml and test.hol have examples. There is
     also a prettyprinter pp_regexp and associated print_regexp.

Regexp_Match.

   * SML implementation of the regexp match compiler. Does not
     generate proofs. Is close to the algorithms in regexpTheory and
     regexp_compilerTheory, having been derived from them. 

   * A version that only runs the search and doesn't post-process to
     obtain the DFA is in the function domBrz. This is useful for
     performance debugging, and for visualizing the workings of the
     algorithm. Visualization is controlled by the "regexp-compiler"
     trace (default is "on").
     

charset{Script,Theory}. 

   * The type of regular expressions uses character sets. Since there
     is more than one way to implement this, we have broken it out
     into a separate theory.

regexp{Script,Theory}.

   * HOL theory of regexps. Much of the Regexp_Match code has been
     hand-translated from this theory.

eq_cmp_bmap{Script,Theory}

   * Extension to the balanced_map theory, to support the common case
     where the set of keys mapping to an element is a singleton. This
     is used to relate balanced_mapTheory to finite_mapTheory.

vec_map{Script,Theory}

   * Support theory for translating maps into vector format.

regexp_compiler{Script,Theory}.

   * HOL theory proving correctness of derivative-based compiler 
    from regexps to DFAs.

regexpSyntax.

    * Support for manipulating regexp abstract syntax trees in HOL.
      Also maps between Regexp_Type.regexp and the HOL regexp type.

regexpLib. 

   * HOL evaluator for the regexp compilation and matching functions
     defined in regexpTheory.

   * A general matcher which allows choosing deduction or SML.

test.{hol,ml}

   * Examples of the application of the compiler/DFA evaluator, with,
     and without, proofs.

regexp2dfa

   * Command-line tool for generating programs (Ada,C,Java,ML) from
     regexps. See codegen/gen_*_files for invocation examples.

codegen

   * Directory of shell scripts demonstrating generation of code from
     regexps.  Contents: gen_ada_files, gen__c_files, ...


Status.
========

Jan 31. 2017.  

* Added some more optimizations to Regexp_Match that aren't in the
  corresponding theories. See regexp_compare and build_or. See also
  the notes in the implementation of domBrz supporting more efficient
  handling of regexps of the form \w{1,n} (or \d{1,n}), which if left
  alone, expose an exponential blow-up. The blow-up is not totally
  defeated, but has been pushed much further away.

* Proved some theorems in regexpScript.sml relating various representations
  of Sigma*

* Regexp_Type : exploring different ways of generating packed intervals. Not
  in its final form, or thoroughly tested.

Feb 13. 2017.  

* Moved formalization of charsets to be word64#word64#word64#word64. This
  will support CakeML translation. However, the implementation of the
  SML regexp compiler in Regexp_Match still uses IntInf as the representation
  of charsets. It might be interesting to compare the two representations for
  efficiency, but that's future work.

* Incorporated in-logic PEG parser for regexps (regexp_parserTheory).
  This was renamed from reSyntax to be in line with the existing naming
  scheme (pre-pending things with "regexp").

* Revised packed interval syntax \p{e_1 ... e_n} to get rid of superfluous
  commas between elements, and to incorporate support for padding.

July 1, 2017

* Converted ML implementation of charsets to
  word64#word64#word64#word64 in order to better align with the HOL
  formalization.

* Replaced regexp2{c,java,ml} by an all-inclusive regexp2dfa. Added options
  for theorem generation and Ada. The usage message looks like

    regexp2dfa: 
    Usage: regexp2dfa [-dfagen (HOL | SML)] (Ada | C | Java | ML | Thm) <name> '<regexp>'

* Updated syntax for some examples.

* codegen/gen_files split out into separate file generators for each language.
