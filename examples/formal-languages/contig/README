Theory of "contiguity types", as discussed in the paper

   "Specifying Message Formats with Contiguity Types", ITP 2021

Contiguity types express formal languages where later parts of a
string may depend on information held earlier in the string. This
makes contig types a tractable class of context-sensitive
languages. They are helpful for expressing serialized data containing,
for example, variable length arrays.

Theories:

  - contig_support: supporting definitions and theorems

  - contig: definition of contig types, plus soundness of a matching algorithm
