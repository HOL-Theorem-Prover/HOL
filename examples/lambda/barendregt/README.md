chap2Script.sml :
               mechanisation of chapter 2 of Hankin's "Lambda calculi:
               a guide for computer scientists"

chap3Script.sml :
               mechanisation of much of chapter 3 of Hankin with bits
               of Barendregt's chapter 3 thrown in too

chap11_1Script.sml :
               mechanisation of section 11.1 from Barendregt's "The
               lambda calculus: its syntax and semantics"

term_posnsScript.sml :
               establishes a type for labelling reductions, and
               positions within terms more generally

finite_developmentsScript.sml :
               Barendregt's proof of the finite-ness of developments
               (section 11.2), mechanising this notion as well as that
               of residuals.

standardisationScript.sml :
               Barendregt's proof of the standardisation theorem, from
               section 11.4.

preltermScript.sml ltermScript.sml :
               script files that establish the type of lambda calculus
               terms with labelled redexes.  Called $\Lambda'$ in
               Barendregt.
