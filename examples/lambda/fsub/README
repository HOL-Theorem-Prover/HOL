A formalisation of the proof that standard and algorithmic sub-typing
relations coincide for two versions of sub-typing for "F sub", that is
System F with subtyping.  Presentation taken from Benjamin Pierce's book,
"Types and programming languages".

(This theory file is broken for the moment while better, more general
infrastructure for creating "nominal" datatypes is developed.)
