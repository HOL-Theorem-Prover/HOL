This is a formalisation of the AKS Main Theorem,
and the implementation of the algorithm in a formalised machine.

## Introspection
* __AKSintro__, introspective relation for special polynomials and special exponents.
* __AKSshift__, introspective shifting: from Zn to Zp, where p is a prime.
* __AKSsets__, introspective sets, for exponents and polynomials.
* __AKSmaps__, mappings between introspective sets and their shadows.

## The AKS Main Theorem
* __AKStheorem__, the AKS Main Theorem, with parameter k be prime.
* __AKSrevised__, the AKS Main Theorem, with parameter k not required to be prime.
* __AKSimproved__, the AKS Main Theorem, with bounds improved.
* __AKSclean__, the AKS Main Theorem, a clean version deducing the parameter k.

## AKS Complexity (work in progress)
* __AKSmachine__, the AKS Machine (still to finish).
* __AKSextra__, extra stuff: monoids of introspective sets, better lower bound, symbolic polynomials. scalar ring.
