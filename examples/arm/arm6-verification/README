This example contains a correctness proof for the ARM6 microprocessor design.

The files are as follows:  

 * armScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM instruction set (v4).

 * coreScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM6 micro-architecture.
    This is based on Daniel Schostak's specification (Leeds). 

 * onestepScript.sml and io_onestepScript.sml: A framework for carrying out
    processor verifications.

 * lemmasScript.sml: Some basic theorems about the ARM models.

 * armLib: Some simple tactics and simpsets.

 * correctness/: contains a proof of correctness (be patient when running!).
