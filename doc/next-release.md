New features:
-------------

*   The special `Type` syntax for making type abbreviations can now map to `temp_type_abbrev` (or `temp_type_abbrev_pp`) by adding the `local` attribute to the name of the abbreviation.

    For example

           Type foo[local] = “:num -> bool # num”

    or

           Type foo[local,pp] = “:num -> bool # num”

    Thanks to Magnus Myreen for the feature suggestion.

*   We have added a special syntactic form `Overload` to replace various flavours of `overload_on` calls.
    The core syntax is exemplified by

           Overload foo = “myterm”

    Attributes can be added after the name.
    Possible attributes are `local` (for overloads that won’t be exported) and `inferior` to cause a call `inferior_overload_on` (which makes the overload the pretty-printer’s last choice).

    Thanks to Magnus Myreen for the feature suggestion.

Bugs fixed:
-----------

*  `extrealTheory`: the old definition of `extreal_add` wrongly allows
   `PosInf + NegInf = PosInf`, while the definition of `extreal_sub` wrongly
    allows `PosInf - PosInf = PosInf` and `NegInf - NegInf = PosInf`. Now
    these cases are unspecified, so is division-by-zero (which is indeed
    allowed for reals in `realTheory`). As a consequence, now all
   `EXTREAL_SUM_IAMGE`-related theorems require that there must be no
    mixing of `PosInf` and `NegInf` in the sum elements.
    A bug in `ext_suminf` with non-positive functions is also fixed.

    There is a major backwards-incompatibility: the above changes may
    lead to more complicated proofs when using extreals, while better 
    alignments with textbook proofs are achieved, on the other hand.

New theories:
-------------

*  `derivativeTheory` and `integrationTheory`: univariate
    differential and integral calculus (based on Henstock-Kurzweil
    Integral, or gauge integral), ported by Muhammad Qasim and Osman
    Hasan from HOL Light (up to 2015).

*  `measureTheory`, `lebesgueTheory`, `martingaleTheory` and `probabilityTheory`:
    the type of measure/probability has been upgrade
    from `('a set) -> real` to `('a set) -> extreal`, better aligned with
    modern textbooks.

    There is a major backwards-incompatibility: old proof scripts
    using real-valued measure and probability theory should now
    instead open `sigma_algebraTheory`, `real_measureTheory`,
    `real_borelTheory`, `real_lebesgueTheory` and `real_probabilityTheory`.

*  `sigma_algebraTheory`: the pure set-theoretic theory of sigma-algebra
    has been moved from `measureTheory` into a dedicated `sigma_algebraTheory`,
    adding also some other system of sets (ring, semiring, and dynkin system).
    This theory is now shared by both `measureTheory` and `real_measureTheory`.

*  `borelTheory`: the extreal-based Borel space and Borel-measurable
    sets is now moved from `measureTheory` into `borelTheory` with
    many new theorems added.

    There is a minor backwards-incompatibility: some old proof scripts using
   `measureTheory` should now also open `sigma_algebraTheory` and `borelTheory`.
