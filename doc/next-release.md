New features
------------
- `Theory` syntax now supports disabling the generation of documentation in `<thyname>Theory.sig` by following the theory name with the `[no_sig_docs]` annotation.
Files that use this feature do not need to mention `Feedback.set_trace "TheoryPP.include_docs" 0` anymore.

Incompatibilities
-----------------

-   The return types of `parse_term.mk_prec_matrix`, `type_grammar.parse_map`, `type_grammar.privileged_abbrevs`
    have been changed to return maps of type HOLdict instead of Binarymap.

-   `Preterm.eq` has been replaced with `Preterm.veq` which returns `true` if and only if the two arguments are variables with the same names and types.

-   We have implemented a new policy forbidding theory names from being SML or HOL keywords (*e.g.,* `case`, `while`, `of`, …, `Theorem`, `Theory`, `Definition`, …).
    The theories `while` and `functor` have been renamed to `While` and `category_functor`, respectively, in accordance with this.

-   The `examples/fun-op-sem` directory has been renamed `examples/pl-semantics`.

-   The `examples/balanced_bst` directory has been renamed `examples/data-structures/balanced_bst`;
    the script file `examples/zipper/zipperScript.sml` has been moved to `examples/data-structures`;
    the script file `examples/balanced_bst/AVL_treeScript.sml` has been moved to a directory of its own at `examples/data-structures/AVL_tree`.
