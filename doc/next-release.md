New features:
-------------

Bugs fixed:
-----------

New theories:
-------------

- `number`, `combinatorics` and `prime`: These theories combine material
   from `examples/algebra/lib`, etc.
   They contain some more advanced results from number theory (in particular properties of prime numbers) and combinatorics.

- `monoid`, `group`, `ring` and `real_algebra`: These theories combine
   material previously held in `examples/algebra`.
   A monoid is an algebraic structure: with a carrier set, a binary operation and an identity element.
   A group is an algebraic structure: a monoid with all its elements invertible.
   A ring takes into account the interplay between its additive group and multiplicative monoid.

New tools:
----------

- `Tactic.TRANS_TAC` (ported from HOL-Light) applies transitivity theorem to goal
  with chosen intermediate term. See its DOC for more details.

- `intLib.INTEGER_TAC` and `intLib.INTEGER_RULE` (ported from HOL-Light): simple
  decision procedures for equations of multivariate polynomials of integers, and
  simple equations about divisibility of integers.

New examples:
-------------

- Dijkstra's algorithm for computing shortest paths: `examples/algorithms/dijkstraScript.sml`

Incompatibilities:
------------------

-   `numLib.prefer_num` has been renamed to `numLib.temp_prefer_num`, which name better describes its semantics.
    The `prefer_num` entry-point is now used to make a change “permanent” (again following the naming convention used by many parsing-related entry-points), which is to say that the overloads made by this function will be exported to child theories.
